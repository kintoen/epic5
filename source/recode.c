/*
 * Here's the plan...
 *
 * * * * * PREFACE 
 *
 * There are three primary inbound sources of information:
 *	1. Stuff you type
 *	2. Scripts you /load
 *	3. Stuff you get from IRC
 * (there are other sources, like DCC CHAT, but those aren't handled yet)
 *
 * In an ideal world, everything would be in UTF-8, but we have to handle
 * data that is not in UTF-8 and we don't know what the encoding is. 
 * There is some research into auto-detection of encoding, but nothing that
 * was mature enough to use.
 *
 * So it falls on you, the user, to use the /ENCODING command to tell the
 * client what to do with things that are not in UTF-8.
 *
 * * * * * HANDLING THE CONSOLE (stuff you type, stuff you see)
 *
 * I've observed there are two types of people:
 *	1. People who don't use 8 bit characters and know nothing of locales
 *	   (lets call those people "English speakers")
 *	2. People who undestand exactly what locale they're using.
 *	   (lets call those people "The World")
 *
 * If you have a locale set up, the client will use that for the encoding
 * used by your terminal emulator.  For most of you, you're using UTF-8.
 * Everything should Just Work for UTF-8 users with properly set locales.
 *
 * For NON-UTF8 users, or those who don't have any idea what a locale is, 
 * the client has to do some fallback.  It's been my observation that 
 * English Speaking UTF-8 users have some idea what locales are, and are 
 * inclined to set up their locale to make it work right.  
 *
 * So my attention falls to people without locales.  I've decided the best
 * choice is to just assume they're using ISO-8859-1.
 *
 * If for any reason, the client doesn't guess right, you can overrule it
 * by using /ENCODING
 * 
 * Maybe you really are using UTF-8 but you don't have your locale set:
 *	/ENCODING console UTF-8
 *
 * Or maybe you're using something else, like KOI8-R
 *	/ENCODING console KOI8-R
 *
 * The client will expect you to type in the console encoding, and will
 * translate all output to the encoding before display.
 *
 * * * * * * HANDLING NON-UTF8, NON-DECLARED SCRIPTS
 *
 * However.... Scripts are not usually encoded in UTF8 because of ascii 
 * art.  Most EPIC5 scripts appear to be encoded in CP437.
 *
 * For scripts that are not encoded in UTF-8, epic needs to convert them.
 * Scripts can make this easy on themselves by using /load -encoding:
 *	if (word(2 $loadinfo()) != [pf]) { load -pf -encoding CP437 $word(1 $loadinfo()); return; }
 *
 * For scripts not in utf8 that don't declare an encoding, the client has to
 * assume *something*, and that is CP437.  This can be overruled with /ENCODING
 *	/ENCODING scripts CP437
 *
 * The benefit of all this is CP437 ascii art will now work correctly for all!
 *
 * * * * * * HANDLING NON-UTF8 STUFF ROM IRC
 * 
 * We receive messages from irc from two different types of sources:
 *	1. Servers (which have a dot in their name)
 *	2. Nicks (which do not have a dot in their name)
 *
 * By default, all outbound messages you send will be in UTF-8, and any 
 * incoming messages in UTF-8 will be handled automatically.
 *
 * There are times when someone on irc will send you a non-utf8 message,
 * or there are people you want to send non-utf8 messages to.
 *
 * Any non-utf8 message you receive from irc will be assumed to be ISO-8859-1
 * and can be overruled by :
 *	/ENCODING irc ISO-8859-1
 *
 * You can overrule this on a server/channel/nick basis:
 *
 * We know "irc.foo.com" uses ISO-8859-15
 *	/ENCODING irc.foo.com KOI8-R
 * or
 *	/ENCODING irc.foo.com/ KOI8-R
 *
 * Across all servers, every 'hop' we know uses ISO-8859-15
 *	/ENCODING hop ISO-8859-15
 * or
 *	/ENCODING /hop ISO-8859-15
 *
 * We only want to set it for 'hop' on EFNet:
 * (non-EFNet 'hop's would use the fallback 'irc' rule unless another rule 
 *  said different)
 *	/ENCODING EFNet/hop ISO-8859-15
 *
 * We know that on #happyfuntime on EFNet, people use ISO-8859-8.
 *	/ENCODING EFNet/#happyfuntime ISO-8859-8
 *
 * The server part can be:
 *	1. A server refnum
 *	2. An "ourname" or "itsname" of the server
 *	3. The server's group
 *	4. Any of the server's altnames
 *	5. The server's 005 NETWORK value
 *
 * Both the server and slash are optional.  Leaving the server blank means
 * "all servers" and a leading slash is handy for nicknames that collide
 * with the builtin names
 * 
 * We know that the user with nick 'console' uses ISO-8859-15
 *	/ENCODING /console ISO-8859-15
