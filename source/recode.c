/*
 * Here's the plan...
 *
 * EPIC wants to handle everything internally as a UTF-8 string, but 
 * sometimes we will receive a non-UTF8 string and have to decide how
 * to convert it into UTF8.
 *
 * There is some research in the topic of automatic encoding detection,
 * and certainly my conversations with epic users tells me that most
 * non-english speakers want to use UTF-8, and english speakers are using
 * UTF-8 implicitly anyways.  So I don't expect this to be too critical
 * to how people use irc.
 *
 * Nevertheless, it is not my desire to cut off people who do not use 
 * UTF-8, either the epic user, or others on irc -- so we need to be 
 * able to tell each other about what encoding we're using.
 *
 * Declare the encoding your terminal emulator uses (if it's not utf-8)
 *	/ENCODING console ISO-8859-1
 *
 * Declare what encoding non-utf8 scripts should be assumed to be
 * (assuming they don't declare their encoding, WHICH THEY SHOULD)
 *	/ENCODING scripts CP437
 *
 * Declare what encoding irc.foo.com uses
 *	/ENCODING irc.foo.com ISO-8859-15
 *
 * Declare what encoding #epic uses on EFNet
 *	/ENCODING EFNet/#epic ISO-8859-1
 *
 * Declare that hop uses ISO-85519-1
 *	/ENCODING hop ISO-8859-1
 *
 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
 *    IMPORTANT! IMPORTANT! IMPORTANT! IMPORTANT! IMPORTANT!   *
 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
 * It is critical to remember the purpose of this is to handle
 * NON-UTF8 strings.  So you may be tempted to say, "oh, I should
 * declare that my channel uses UTF-8", but EPIC already knows
 * how to handle that.  What you want to do is tell EPIC what to 
 * do with NON-UTF8 stuff it comes across.
 *
 * So the encoding of a target must not be UTF-8, and EPIC will 
 * remind you of this if you try.
