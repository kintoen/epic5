/*
 * Here's the plan -- a two-phase data buffering system that can be adapted
 * to systems with fully asynchronous i/o (vms, threads).
 *
 * Each file descriptor is tracked based on two things:
 *	1) How the fd produces data.
 *	2) A function to call when there is data to consume.
 *
 * At the highest level, a file descriptor is declared for use with
 *
 *	int new_open (int fd, void (*callback)(int), int io_type)
 *
 * whereby we provide the file descriptor, the consumer callback, and the
 * io production type.  After calling new_open(), you must never call read()
 * or write() or accept() or connect() on the fd.
 *
 * Newio arranges for the file descriptor to send any data it generates to
 * the dgets buffers:
 *	int dgets_buffer (int fd, void *data, size_t len)
 * When data is generated and buffered, the file descriptor is considered
 * "dirty" ("not clean").  After a file descriptor is dirty, your callback
 * is repeatedly called until the file descriptor is no longer dirty.
 *
 * Your callback can clean a file descriptor by calling dgets():
 *	ssize_t	dgets (int des, char *buf, size_t buflen, int buffer)
 * Dgets() will remove some data from the buffer and return it to you.
 * 'buffer' controls how much data you want dgets() to return.
 *
 * When all file descriptors are "clean", the do_wait() function is called,
 * and it is expected to return when one or more file descriptors are "dirty"
 * or when the timeout expires.  After it returns, do_filedesc() is called
 * to "clean" all of the dirty file descriptors by repeatedly calling your
 * provided callback.
 *
 * So here is the flow of the system:
 *	1) You create a file descriptor
 * 	2) Call new_open()
 *	3) Call do_wait()
 *	4) Call handle_filedesc()
 *	   4a) This will call your callbacks on any dirty fd's.
 *	5) Go back to 3
 *	
 * This is the essential parts of the main loop that drives EPIC.
 *
 * 
 * Questions and answers:
 * Q) So how is this different than what was done before?
 * A) Before, do_wait() returned when an IO operation was possible, and 
 *    your callback was expected to perform the operation (usually by calling
 *    dgets() with a io callback).  Now, the IO operation is performed before
 *    do_wait() returns, and the only thing dgets() does is copy data from
 *    its buffers to yours.  Therefore, you can call dgets() anytime and it
 *    will never block.
 * Q) Should I create a loop around dgets() in my callback?
 * A) That is not necessary.  Your callback should just perform one logical
 *    operation.  If there is more data left, your callback will be called
 *    again until you've exhausted all of the data.  An implied loop around 
 *    dgets() is a of this system.
 * Q) Why does this documentation suck so much?
 * A) I wrote it in a big hurry.  Maybe I'll "fix" it again later.
