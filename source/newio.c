/*
 * This file contains two major sections, which deal with multiplexing I/O 
 * intended for systems that have integer based file descriptors.  Porting
 * this to work on other integer based file descriptor systems should be 
 * pretty easy, and doesn't require changing anything else in EPIC.  Systems
 * that use something other than integers for file descriptors will require
 * more work, but shouldn't be /too/ difficult.
 *
 * In section 1, is "dgets", which does line-buffering on any file
 * descriptor in the same way fgets() does for (FILE *)s.  Everything in 
 * EPIC that does line buffering uses dgets() to handle this job.
 *
 * "dgets" includes these functions:
 *   get_pending_bytes(), which returns the number of bytes buffered by 
 *		the dgets system for a file descriptor.  
 *   init_io(), which initializes the dgets() subsystem.  The name sucks.
 *   unix_read(), which is a dgets() reader function that uses the unix
 *		read(2) system call to fill the buffers.
 *   dgets() which takes a file descriptor, a buffer, a buffer size, and 
 *		a reader callback function.  dgets() works in two steps,
 *		first filling its own buffers with a supplied reader func,
 *		and then returning the first line from this buffer.  Further
 *		lines will be returned in subsequent calls to dgets().
 * Making "dgets" work on non-unix systems is as simple as replacing the 
 * "unix_read()" function with whatever you use on the new system to pull
 * bytes off of a file descriptor.  The rest of EPIC does not need to be
 * changed, though you may want to look at how servers work with SSL.
 * 
 * In section 2, are the "event drivers" which are sets of functions that 
 * handle the management of file descriptors and a "sleep function" which 
 * epic calls when it has nothing else to do, and which does not return 
 * until there is something to do.  See newio.h for a lot more info, but
 * basically there are implementations for unix select(2) and freebsd's 
 * kqueue(2) systems here.  You should be able to write new sets of functions
 * for non-unix systems (like VMS) pretty easily, and nothing else in EPIC
 * need change.

/*
 * All new dgets -- no more trap doors!
 *
 * There are at least four ways to look at this function.
 * The most important variable is 'buffer', which determines if
 * we force line buffering.  If it is on, then we will sit on any
 * incomplete lines until they get a newline.  This is the default
 * behavior for server connections, because they *must* be line
 * delineated.  However, when are getting input from an untrusted
 * source (eg, dcc chat, /exec'd process), we cannot assume that every
 * line will be newline delinated.  So in those cases, 'buffer' is 0,
 * and we force a flush on whatever we can slurp, without waiting for
 * a newline.
 *
 * Return values:
 *
 *	-1 -- The file descriptor is dead.  Either an EOF occured, or a
 *	      read() error occured, or the buffer for the filedesc filled
 *	      up, or some other non-recoverable error occured.
 *	 0 -- If the data read in from the file descriptor did not form a 
 *	      complete line, then zero is always returned.  This should be
 *	      considered a stopping condition.  Do not call dgets() again
 *	      after it returns 0, because unless more data is avaiable on
 *	      the fd, it will return -1, which you would misinterpret as an
 *	      error condition.
 *	      If "buffer" is 0, then whatever we have available will be 
 *	      returned in "str".
 *	      If "buffer" is not 0, then we will retain whatever we have
 *	      available, waiting for the newline to occur perhaps next time.
 *	>0 -- If a full, newline terminated line was available, the length
 *	      of the line is returned.
