------------------------------------------------
<none>

LOOK FOR IN THE FUTURE
-----------------------
* Finish refactoring the input prompt, by showing the prompt all the time,
  eliminating one-column-per-byte assumption.
* There is confusion between "proto" "type" and "addrfamily" with server
  stuff.  Normalize and redocument.
* send_text() needs rework, to add extra /on's so you can flag those special. 
* Lastlog improvements (unified lastlog, refnums, moving between windows, etc)
* Import utf8 support from ircII OR add support for utf16 (wide chars)
* Import fg/bg color support from ircII 
* 8-bit color support (256 colors for xterm) (rb larne)
* Improvements for LOAD_PATH; directories, zip files, filename caching.
* UPnP support via http://miniupnp.free.fr/
* Some way to call an alias in a variable indirectly
* Output rules
* Support for CNOTICE
* /CTCPs over /DCCs don't match up with their queries very well. (nullie)
* $xform()s for SED and DEF
* str_to_mask() should be silent, callers should be warning.
* Support for 64 bit ints could be more widespread
* Larne wants suppression of duplicated lines (like syslog maybe?)
* Refactor hardcoded uses of select() so select() isn't mandatory.
* Shattah would like something like /window omit <regex> to remove stuff.

[See http://www.epicsol.org/CHANGELOG5 for things that changed in the past]

THE CHANGELOG SINCE THE LAST RELEASE:
-------------------------------------
* Change 'wserv4' to 'epic5-wserv4' to avoid conflicting with epic4.
* Fix output of /disconnect when disconnected to be less confusing.
* Some changes to tabkey.jm to see if we can get it working.
* Move some functions out of input.c to better places.
* Fix normalization bug via $stripcrap(all ^C0@^Otest) (from kitambi)
* Fix denormalization bug via $leftpc(9 ^C0@^Otest) (from kitambi)
* Make the activity script use its own /package.
* Enhance prntdump() to convert unprintable chars to hex.
* Change /set -word_break so it pretends you set it to " \t" (rb kitambi)
* Add socks5p.h from epic4 so we can build with socks5 again.
* Remember, it's ./configure --with-socks5=/usr/local/lib
* Make update_input() take a screen as an argument, to update one screen only.
* Make /window create screen's input lines work again (rb kitambi)
* Fix crash from /parsekey type_text
* Add ^Vs to the start of  DEFAULT_STATUS_FORMAT* in config.h
* Comment out code for /set reverse_status_line pending removal later.
* GC the code for -f/-F/-o/-O command line arguments
* Fix the serverctl() comment for howl
* Change /say (or the empty command) to send to channel first, query second
* Add $dccctl(SET|GET ref WANT_PORT) to set the -p flag.
* Change tabkey.jm to use /msg -serv/nick instead of /msg serv:nick
* Add dccctl(DEFAULT_PORT <string>) [see UPDATES]
* Add /on dcc_lost case for cant-bind-port [see UPDATES]
* Add 'dcc_ports' script [see UPDATES]
* Add mask_to_(positive|negative)_str to convert masks to shorter strings
* So now mask_to_str() returns strings like "ALL -DCC" if it's shorter!
