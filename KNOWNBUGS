[See http://www.epicsol.org/PROJECTS for things to come in the future]
[See http://www.epicsol.org/CHANGELOG5 for things that changed in the past]

THE CHANGELOG SINCE THE LAST RELEASE:
-------------------------------------
* Patch from twincest to fix build on solaris
* Don't honor queries for WALLOPS (requested by opers)
* Conditionalize <ieeefp.h> per twincest's fix.
* Clear RUBYDOTOH if ruby is found but it isn't usable (rb Zoopee)
* Rewrite checks for (intmax_t) for systems w/o strtoimax(). (rb JailBird)
* Define NSIG as _NSIG or 32 if it's not defined (rb JailBird)
* Broaden what you can specify for the server "proto" field (see UPDATES)
* Fix figure_out_address() to properly identify a server name
* This fixes /ignore user@host.com which was lamely broken.
* Make /window channel output all channels in the window
* Don't call update_all_status() if /set -status_clock (by Oliver Fromme)
* Comment out strtol() compat stuff, causing people problems.
* More graciously handle snprintf() returning -1 (rb twincest)
* Do not use /usr/include/ep on hpux
* Mark lastlog items as "dead" and check for them to avoid dangling ptrs
* Handle (graciously) when /set scroll_lines is > size of the window. (rb CE)
