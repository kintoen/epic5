<none>

LOOK FOR IN THE FUTURE
-----------------------
* Output rules
* Support for CNOTICE
* More gracious support for trickling horizontal resizes down to the window.
* /window <refnum> noserv causes bad fd loop.  (can't reproduce?)
* Is there some way to set what ^O resets to, a la mirc?
* /CTCPs over /DCCs don't match up with their queries very well.
* $xform()s for SED and DEF
* str_to_mask() should be silent, callers should be warning.
* Add /window indent, to overrule /set indent.
* A way to control what counts as a space on the fly (via a /set?)
* Handling keypresses should overrule protocol enforcement (on_notice, etc)
* Support for 64 bit ints could be more widespread
