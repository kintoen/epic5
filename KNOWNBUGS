EPIC4 Projects, Bugs, and other Errata:

KNOWN ERRATA (eg, bugs, or unresolved requests):
------------------------------------------------
* A missing 'else' in create_additional_screen causes gnu screen to be
  prefered over X windows.  Should this be fixed, or at least made an option?
  Maybe try X, fall back to gnu screen on failure?
* Should /set beep off suppress stripping of beeps?
* /TYPE honors keybindings, and calls edit_char(), but /XTYPE -L does not 
  honor key bindings because it calls input_add_character().
* Study update_input() and update_all_windows() and determine if used properly
* Shall remove_trailing_spaces honor a \ before a space trailing?
* Some way to color the input prompt?  (Probably not)
* The way the pattern matcher handles ?'s after *'s is really lame.
* /window disconnect (server -> -2) + /server 0 reconnects to previous server.
* Something for %D to make it customizable?
* [7] <- [:aussie.sydney.oz.org 330 complexnes Veneficus Veneficus

* $indextoword() and extractw() don't play nice together.
* /dcc chat hop from an ipv6 server connection will default to ipv4 bind(),
  but send out an ipv6 address in the handshake. (send_booster_ctcp doesn't
  check what protocol get_server_local_address() returns.)

[See http://www.epicsol.org/PROJECTS for things to come in the future]
[See http://www.epicsol.org/CHANGELOG for things that changed in the past]

THE CHANGELOG SINCE THE LAST RELEASE:
-------------------------------------
* Allow $serverctl(SET <refnum> UMODES) to work around ratbox-1.2-3.
