EPIC4 Projects, Bugs, and other Errata:

KNOWN ERRATA (eg, bugs, or unresolved requests):
------------------------------------------------
* A missing 'else' in create_additional_screen causes gnu screen to be
  prefered over X windows.  Should this be fixed, or at least made an option?
  Maybe try X, fall back to gnu screen on failure?
* If you create a new query window in /on #msg -33, then the message does
  not go to that query window!
 
[See http://www.epicsol.org/PROJECTS for things to come in the future]
[See http://www.epicsol.org/CHANGELOG for things that changed in the past]

THE CHANGELOG SINCE THE LAST RELEASE:
-------------------------------------
* Add $fskip(), $fseek(), $frewind(), $ferror() and $isfilevalid().
* Gid rid of the awful bsd_*env() hacks in compat.c.
* Start using getenv() and setenv() like normal programs do.
* Fix /setenv so you can unset env variables with /setenv -VARNAME
* "Ooops"  I didn't sort fskip/fseek/frewind/ferror in the functions list.
* Migrate the io() looper to using 'struct timeval's instead of time_t's
* Migrate /timer to use 'struct timeval's instead of time_t's
* Make 'start_time' and 'idle_time' struct timeval's, for future use.
* Add some functions to ircaux.c to make manipulating timevals easier.
* Migrate calc_speed in dcc.c to using 'struct timeval's instead of time_t's
* Fix /xecho -v
* Make /pause take a fractional argument, ie, /pause 1.5
* Implement "redirect sink", nickname 0, causes all output to be suppressed
* Implement /flush to use the redirect sink instead of throwing out good data.
  -- This means /flush is safe to use again!  Huzzah!
* You can use /REDIRECT 0 WHOIS <nick> for example to suppress "extra" output
* Resizable wserv support, merged from epic5.
* New highlight renderer, from epic5.  Touches a lot of stuff.  May break?
* Honor attribute markup in /set continued_line
* Save attributes from the end of one line to after the continued_Line.
* What this means is that attributes in /set continued_line don't "bleed"
* Add support for ~/.epicrc which is prefered to ~/.ircrc.
* Fix the "Warning, file exists" check for dcc to honor /set dcc_store_path.
* Add $info(i), which is the commit_id.  I should have added this long ago.
* Fix $read() to accept lines of any length (crazyeddy)
* Fix window_disp() to pass raw display strings to lastlog and log.
* Fix $status() to return a denormalized string.
* Fix bug where cursor would not be returned to input line after status update
* Make the output of /query go to the affected window.
* Thwart attempts to /JOIN (/window rejoin) to an unconnected server.
* Start exposing commit_id to the user, for bug reporting purposes.
* Increase the precision of floating point results to 999 decimal places (ce)
* Don't hook /on general_notice if user hooks /on kill or /on oper_notice.
* Fix bug that showed all timers as having 0 seconds left.
* Fix $printlen() -- must call normalize_string() before output_with_count()!
* Make 'add_to_window' and 'window_disp' static to screen.c again.
* "Fix" /WINDOW ECHO to not call add_to_window() but rather use "to_window".
* Add support for $write[b]() to logfiles; prefix window refnum with 'w'.
* Add support for $write[b]() to global logfile; logref "w-1".
* Add $ceil(), $floor(), $abs() (crazyeddy)
* Fix $trunc(... 0) to truncate number to an integer (crazyeddy)
* Print floating point numbers with up to 50 places of precision.
* Add a new argument to /encrypt, an external encryption filter.
* Add epic-crypt-gpg and epic-crypt-gpg-aa to the script/ directory.
* Fix bug with ROM_CHAR handling.
* Add MIN()/MAX() macros for systems that don't define one.
* Add an exec_pipe() function which returns the results of an ext. prog. (ce)
* Fix integer math (ce)
* Avoid using trunc(3), nonportable; use fmod() isntead (ce)
* Always make sure Attributes are initialized before first use.
* Add compat hacks for broken systems lacking setenv() and unsetenv().
* CTCP SEDs recieved in NOTICEs are treated as CTCP REPLIES not queries. (ce)
* Added $encryptparm() -- returns all information about /encrypt entries. (ce)
* Fix prepare_display to append a zero-Attribute and not ^O to end of line.
* "Fix" /queue so it doesn't double-eval your commands at runtime.
* Revert last change
* "Fix" /queue so it doesn't double-eval your commands up front.
* Fixed ctrl-e (alt-char) problems.  Thanks to desaster and knghtbrd.
* Disabled ROM characters.  Many thanks to zinx for figuring it all out.
* Add /SET ROM_CHAR, which controls parsing of ^R codes, default is OFF.
* Re-enabled ROM characters, now that they can be /SET off.
* Remove /SET ROM_CHAR, and the rom_char handling stuff entirely.
* Add /SET ALLOW_C1_CHAR which defaults to off, to [dis]allow ascii 128-159.
