* There needs to be an /on switch_query for wuf/sjhoran

	*!*user@*.com.au but instead *!*user@*.domain.com.au
* The FiSH cipher will be EVP_bf_ecb(void) with an SHA256 key.
  (FiSH == BLOWFISH_ECB_SHA)
* There should be a watch to check for the validity of a $connect() 
  by working directly off the fd instead of the port (user) and host (desc)
* enquote_it and dequote_it (ctcp) users need to migrate to the xforms.

ISSUES OF INTEREST

[See http://www.epicsol.org/CHANGELOG5 for things that changed in the past]

THE CHANGELOG SINCE THE LAST RELEASE:
-------------------------------------
* Patch from twincest to fix build on solaris
* Don't honor queries for WALLOPS (requested by opers)
* Conditionalize <ieeefp.h> per twincest's fix.
* Clear RUBYDOTOH if ruby is found but it isn't usable (rb Zoopee)
* Rewrite checks for (intmax_t) for systems w/o strtoimax(). (rb JailBird)
* Define NSIG as _NSIG or 32 if it's not defined (rb JailBird)
* Broaden what you can specify for the server "proto" field (see UPDATES)
* Fix figure_out_address() to properly identify a server name
* This fixes /ignore user@host.com which was lamely broken.
* Make /window channel output all channels in the window
* Don't call update_all_status() if /set -status_clock (by Oliver Fromme)
* Comment out strtol() compat stuff, causing people problems.
* More graciously handle snprintf() returning -1 (rb twincest)
* Do not use /usr/include/ep on hpux
* Mark lastlog items as "dead" and check for them to avoid dangling ptrs
* Handle (graciously) when /set scroll_lines is > size of the window. (rb CE)
* Properly handle remove_lastlog_item() for the very last item.
* Fixes /eval defer window new kill;defer window new;defer window kill_others
* Add $hookctl(ARGS <recursive> <args>) allows you to replace $* in /on.
* Add $hookctl(USERINFO <recursive> <info>) allows you to set dynamic info.
* Don't lamely malloc_strcpy() over non-malloced strings in hookctl.
* Add $iconvctl() to control iconv stuff. (See UPDATES.)
* Add $xform(iconv +<iconv id>) functionality. (See UPDATES.)
* Fix bug where /window number could lead to confused lastlogs
* Generalize base64 encoding so it doesn't hardcode the base64 string.
* Add $xform(+FISH64 ...) which does FiSH's base64 encoding.
* Make a better test for embedded perl support by calling SvTRUE().
* Fix /bind -defaults so it actually removes all keybindings first. doh.
* Fix /window double so it actually shows you the current double status.
* Make the expression error for too many operands output the expression.
* Rewrite the iconv() configure checks to deal with libiconv's #define's.
* Rewrite the strtoimax() tests so they don't fail lamely to detect (intmax_t)
* Rewrite the perl and ruby runtime configure tests so they work right with gcc
* Fix various warnings revealed by gcc warnings
* Make a very preliminary attempt to write some fish decoding stuff. Not Ready!
* Fix for configure to handle perl's non-existance (kreca)
* Fix wserv4 dependencies so you can do make -j4 on multi-cpu.
* Rework the ruby checking in configure so it builds on freebsd-7
* Add CTCP FISH support (this is _not_ fish support!), see UPDATES
* Make an initial stab at proper support for FiSH's base64 converter.
* I took the "fish64" entry out of $xform() for now while it's broken.
* Capture stdout of ruby scripts and send it to an epic window. yay!
* This means you can do regular old 'puts' in ruby script and it'll Just Work.
* Finish $xform() for +fish64 and -fish64, verified against actual FiSH code
* Try to make the perl configure check more robust for non-working perls.
