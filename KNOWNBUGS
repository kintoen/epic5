EPIC4 Projects, Bugs, and other Errata:

KNOWN ERRATA (eg, bugs, or unresolved requests):
------------------------------------------------
* A missing 'else' in create_additional_screen causes gnu screen to be
  prefered over X windows.  Should this be fixed, or at least made an option?
  Maybe try X, fall back to gnu screen on failure?
* Should /set beep off suppress stripping of beeps?
* Allegedly 464 numeric shouldn't force a reconnect if we're registered.
* The mangler might expand things more than 3 times -- possible
  interference from the attribute parser?  caused by many ^v's.
* Add /timer -delete_for_window or something to avoid window switch warnings?
* After calling connectory(), try to output meaningful error messages, not 
  just blindly calling my_strerror(errno).
* scrollback/scrollforward/scrollend should be controlled by /window verbs
  and not solely by keybindings.
* /TYPE honors keybindings, and calls edit_char(), but /XTYPE -L does not 
  honor key bindings because it calls input_add_character().
* /DEFER needs to be server-specific.
* The check for "sun_len" in <sys/un.h> is bogus and unnecessary since we
  can just use #ifdef HAVE_SA_LEN for that.
* Input cursor wigs out if 2ndary window is < 32 columns wide...
* ^C,,, eats up all commas, not just the first one.
* Join #foo, then join #foobar, doesn't WHO for #foobar (maxxx)
* Handle all filesizes in dcc uniformly as 64 bit off_t's.
* Built in functions need to call 'parse_server_index'!
