[See http://www.epicsol.org/PROJECTS for things to come in the future]
[See http://www.epicsol.org/CHANGELOG5 for things that changed in the past]

THE CHANGELOG SINCE THE LAST RELEASE:
-------------------------------------
* Make GET_INT_ARG() support 64 bit ints, for future use
* Make $fseek() support 64 bit file offsets (yay!)
* Begin converting some time_t uses over to 64 bits, Just In Case
* Make $numsort(), $strtol(), $tobase() support 64 bit ints.
* Make $stat() support 64 bit ints where possible.
* Add 'channelmonitor' script from larne.  Thanks!
* Whack /set highlight_char which is no longer being used.
* Move away from calling parse_line() and runcmds(), towards the call_* funcs
* Add provisional support for renumbering windows with channels/logs/timers
* Constify get_*_alias(), so lookups can't modify the actual alias this way.
* Rename parse_command() to parse_statement().
* Create a next_statement() to figure out how long the next stmt is.
* Stop using expand_alias() to rip apart statements. yay!
* Refactor parse_command and parse_statement to better define their roles.
* Push responsibility for expansion to parse_statement, someday, to cmds!
* Push responsibility for handling block statements to parse_statement.
* "Forget" to re-implement /set input_aliases.  I wonder if anyone will notice.
* Change the name of "hist_flag" to "interactive" to reflect its purpose.
* Change /load -std to use parse_statement() instead of parse_line()
