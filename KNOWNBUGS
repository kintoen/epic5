EPIC4 Projects, Bugs, and other Errata:

KNOWN ERRATA (eg, bugs, or unresolved requests):
------------------------------------------------
* A missing 'else' in create_additional_screen causes gnu screen to be
  prefered over X windows.  Should this be fixed, or at least made an option?
  Maybe try X, fall back to gnu screen on failure?
* You can't unset environment variables.

[See http://www.epicsol.org/CHANGELOG for things that changed in the past]

THE CHANGELOG SINCE THE LAST RELEASE:
-------------------------------------
* Two timers could end up using the same refnum (|Rain|)
* Channels could become confused after being klined (HSOC)
* Fix crashes caused by syntax errors with "/for i in" and "/for i in (foo) {"
* Fix crash if you do /set -status_channel
* Crazyeddy's fixes went here -- someone want to describe them?
* Internal perl support: $perl(), $perlcall(), $perlxcall() functions. (ce)
* Fix $jot() so it works for all cases (ce)
* String operation optimizations to speed up epic. (ce)
* Rewrite the better part of $uniq() (ce)
* Implement a regular version of really_new_realloc(), which is not
* -- just a wrapper to malloc/free. (ce)
* Permit changes to /set notify_interval to take effect immediately. (ce)
* Add an internal file_exists() function, might come in handy some day.
* Permit double-quotes around target of /msg, for compatability with /query. 
* Fix possible problems in the word breaker in ircaux.c
* Fix server assignment in /exec so it works in /on's again.
* Fix failsafe declaration for MAXPATHLEN for hurd in irc_std.h and glob.c.
* Fixes to make dcc-over-ctcp-over-dcc work again (|Rain|)
* Fix $querywin() so it can take a second argument, a server ref (for scromp)
* Add $halfop(), returns +h status (1, 0, -1) (Ay-ar)
* Add the 'autoget' script, for autogetting files via dcc chat.
* Add /window rebind, which moves a channel binding forcibly to a new window
* Add /window rejoin, which joins a channel in the window you want it to go.
* Make /join use /window rejoin, you can use it in an /on now! Huzzah!
* Fix move_channel_to_window to revoke /window bind when a chan moves away.
* Fix possible null deref in move_channel_to_window when window not bound. (ce)
* Fix general bogons in /queue to make it play nice with bounds checking gcc.
* /Queue names are now case-preserving, not always folded to uppercase.
* If you /set -var, give it the actual value NULL, not the empty string (ce)
* -- This apparantly fixes /stack push|pop set ... (ce)
* Fix /window rejoin to actually slurp it's arguments, not copy them (ce) 
* Fix /window rejoin to properly paste channels-to-join together (ce)
* Add integrated random local support with firewall holes.
* Fix bug with /hostname causing dcc to fail if you gave it a bad hostname.
* Add support for server groups; reconnect() takes an extra argument now.
* Server group names are strings of any length. 
* The server group is specified as a new section at the end of server descs.
* The "default" server group's name is the empty string.
* The server list file can contain [server group] headers and # comments.
* Add $ishalfop() function to get +h channel status for a user.
* Add $igetrmatches() function.
* Add secnod argument to $querywin(), a server refnum
* Fix null deref with $uniq( )
* Don't prepend a second / to items coming out of history matching (ce)
* Don't skip over most recent entry in history in history matching (ce)
* Completely new /lastlog command, it doesn't suck!
* Remove all inferences that servers that unnecesarily and gratuitously break
  client intercompatability by deviating from longstanding historical practices
  are ``broken''.  Done under protest and under duress from Dianora who was 
  beligerantly screaming at me that any problems I had with compatability were 
  entirely my fault because I did not sufficiently test for the unknown.  If 
  you don't like this comment, maybe that will remind you to be more polite 
  and diplomatic about working with your peers who judge you based on your 
  behavior towards them.  If you want this to go away, all you have to do is
  apologize for your thoughtless rudeness.
* Make the unused /set notify_handler go away.
* Fix null deref if user does /set -channel_format. doh!
* Make move_channel_to_window() do automatic de-binding for us.
* This means we can fix /window channel to not hunt for the "other" window.
* Fix /window channel to use send_to_aserver().
