EPIC4 Projects, Bugs, and other Errata:

KNOWN ERRATA (eg, bugs, or unresolved requests):
------------------------------------------------
* A missing 'else' in create_additional_screen causes gnu screen to be
  prefered over X windows.  Should this be fixed, or at least made an option?
  Maybe try X, fall back to gnu screen on failure?
* If you create a new query window in /on #msg -33, then the message does
  not go to that query window!

THE CHANGELOG SINCE THE LAST RELEASE:
-------------------------------------
* Add $fskip(), $fseek(), $frewind(), $ferror() and $isfilevalid().
* Gid rid of the awful bsd_*env() hacks in compat.c.
* Start using getenv() and setenv() like normal programs do.
* Fix /setenv so you can unset env variables with /setenv -VARNAME
* "Ooops"  I didn't sort fskip/fseek/frewind/ferror in the functions list.
* Migrate the io() looper to using 'struct timeval's instead of time_t's
* Migrate /timer to use 'struct timeval's instead of time_t's
* Make 'start_time' and 'idle_time' struct timeval's, for future use.

* Migrate calc_speed in dcc.c to using 'struct timeval's instead of time_t's
* Fix /xecho -v
* Make /pause take a fractional argument, ie, /pause 1.5
* Make /timer take a fractional argument, ie, /timer 1.5 ....
