[See http://www.epicsol.org/PROJECTS for things to come in the future]
[See http://www.epicsol.org/CHANGELOG5 for things that changed in the past]

THE CHANGELOG SINCE THE LAST RELEASE:
-------------------------------------
* Nix auto-append-of-$* feature (args_flag to expand_alias/parse_inline) HUZZAH!
* Fix provided scripts to add $* when necessary.
* Fix up Makefile, configure, et al, to use epic5/ directories.
* Make message_from() work from a queue; call pop_message_from() to GC
* Removed unused variables
* Add /xdebug message_from to watch the message_from queue at work.
* Nix save_message_from(), restore_message_from(), unneeded now.
* Remove /set beep_on_msg, a half-broken feature which can be scripted.
* Nix /set beep_when_away, a 1-line scriptable feature.
* Add new noise level %, (/ON %TYPE); like ^ but doesn't turn off display
* Use message_from() for setting all target/levels
* Nix set_lastlog_message_level(), have lastlog use who_level/who_from now
* Make message_from() use a queue to store old values
* Make everybody pop off their message_from() under pain of panic
* This ensures every output context can be safely interrupted!  HUZZAH!
* Unify the flood, ignore, and lastlog levels.
* *_FLOOD -> LEVEL_*, LOG_* -> LEVEL_*, IGNORE_* -> LEVEL_*
* Add KICK, QUIT, and MODE levels
* Nix #define DEFAULT_BEEP_ON_MSG and #define DEFAULT_BEEP_WHEN_AWAY
* Differentiate between a "mask" (bitmask) and a "level" (integer)
* Don't call them "lastlog levels" any more, they're just "levels"
* Create levels.h, which contain the definitions for all of the level stuff
* Create macro, _X(x) which converts a level name to a mask
* Create macro, _Y(x) which converts a level integer to a mask
* Nix beep_on_level global variable
* Create "Mask" struct which contains an integer to hide a "mask" behind.
* This prevents me from comparing a "mask" to a "level" by mistake.
* Convert many functions and variables to the "Mask" type
* Rename a bunch of functions and variables that use "mask" and not "level"
* Make KICKs, PARTs, QUITs, MODEs, et al use their new special levels!
* All levels now mean everything in every context!  HUZZAH! 
* Make empty_string const.  Now we're cooking with gas! 
* Const correctness madness!
* Compile /ON patterns into regexes and use regexec() to parse them.
