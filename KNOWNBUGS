EPIC4 Projects, Bugs, and other Errata:

KNOWN ERRATA (eg, bugs, or unresolved requests):
------------------------------------------------
* A missing 'else' in create_additional_screen causes gnu screen to be
  prefered over X windows.  Should this be fixed, or at least made an option?
  Maybe try X, fall back to gnu screen on failure?
* Should /set beep off suppress stripping of beeps?
* /TYPE honors keybindings, and calls edit_char(), but /XTYPE -L does not 
  honor key bindings because it calls input_add_character().
* Join #foo, then join #foobar, doesn't WHO for #foobar (maxxx)
* Study update_input() and update_all_windows() and determine if used properly
* DCC send yourself a file and then DCC get it leads to wackiness
* New function, you give it a window level, it gives you the window refnum
* IPV6-over-dcc, i promised morty i would.
* Shall remove_trailing_spaces honor a \ before a space trailing?
* New built in function to get who_from and who_level

[See http://www.epicsol.org/CHANGELOG for things that changed in the past]

THE CHANGELOG SINCE THE LAST RELEASE:
-------------------------------------
* New /set, /SET SWITCH_CHANNELS_BETWEEN_WINDOWS
* C language issues (const correctness, integer size correctness)
* Revamp channel structure to hold window refnum and not window pointer
* Add "current channel counter" to channel structure.
* Determine "current channel" by election.
* Garbage collect a lot of now unnecessary code.
* Add get_echannel_by_refnum(), returns window's "elected" current channel
* Add internal function is_waiting_for_channel()
* Add internal function move_waiting_channel()
* Add internal function get_winref_by_bound_channel()
* Add internal function get_bound_channel_by_refnum()
* Convert uses of get_channel_by_refnum() to get_echannel_by_refnum()
* Fix $winbound() to work when given a window refnum
* Fix valgrind issue with $regcomp()
* Remove sanity checks from traverse_all_channels(); handled elsewhere now
* Change traverse_all_channels() with "this server" or "not this server" arg
* Nuke (Window *)->current_channel.  Handled by channels now.  HUZZAH!
* Implement /ON SWITCH_WINDOWS again.
* Fix typo in names.h
* Don't use isinf(), it's a bsd-ism, use !finite() instead.
* Don't hold elections for illegal window refnums.
* Channel can't be current if it's not in a window.
* Fix status_voice().
* Fix $stat() so that it expands ~ correctly.
* Fix ctcp over dcc to not coredump.
* Fix dcc over dcc to not coredump.  (different issue)
* Add %{1}+ as a special favor to howl.
* Convert all uses of strcpy() to strlcpy()
* Convert all uses of strcat() to strlcat()
* Convert all uses of strmcpy() to strlcpy()
* Convert all uses of strmcat() to strlcat()
* Convert all uses of sprintf() to snprintf()
* As much as possible, use 'sizeof var' in snprintf/strlcpy/strlcat.
* Qualify the size of some global vars so we can sizeof() them.
* Nuke strmcpy(), strmcat(), strmcat_ue(), strmccat(),
* Change strmopencat() to strlopencat().
* Change strmpcat() to strlpcat().
* Fix switch_hostname so it doesn't return a (const) string.
* Fix TimerTimeout so it doesn't return a (const) Timeval.
* Change things like (ret) to do ret while (0); for when "ret" is "{}".
* Fix initialization for load_level
* Stop passing in static strings into io(), so we can modify them.
* Make messages passed to io() more informative to the user.
* Fix CTCP FINGER handler not to assume (struct pw) strings can be overwritten.
* Use (socklen_t) and not an (int) for socket sizes.
* Don't return a value in a void function...
* Don't use return value of process_dcc_chat_ctcps() for assignment.
* Don't put semicolons after function bodies
* Fix $getopt() to save 'input_size' so we can use it with strl*().
* Convert all uses of stpcpy() to strlcat() and strlopencat().
* Nix checks for stpcpy() in configure -- regen configure.
* Include strlcpy() in wserv.c for use by gailib.c.
