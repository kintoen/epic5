KNOWN ERRATA (eg, bugs, or unresolved requests):

[See http://www.epicsol.org/PROJECTS for things to come in the future]
[See http://www.epicsol.org/CHANGELOG for things that changed in the past]

THE CHANGELOG SINCE THE LAST RELEASE:
-------------------------------------
* Implement experimental infinte recursion detector, see config.h
* current_window_priority should be global variable
* Valgrind is my hero -- fix buffer underruns with mangle_line().
* Make the "current input window" its server's current window on user input.
* Fix a possible logic hole in ok_to_output().
