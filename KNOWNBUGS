[See http://www.epicsol.org/CHANGELOG for things that changed in the past]

THE CHANGELOG SINCE THE LAST RELEASE:

* Add checks in configure for (long long)
* Make support for (long long) unconditional in new math parser
* Make 'l' appear in $info(o) if (long long) is being used in new math parser.
* Make wrapper for atoll() for freebsd-stable and stuff.
* Make a more complicated wrapper for atoll() for libc5 and stuff.
* Fix panics when changing hidden window's double status bar status.
* Fix /lastlog <number> for kanan. 
* Add /ON WINDOW_COMMAND, hooked after every /window command, $* is refnum.
* Add concept of "fixed" or "frozen" windows when you SKIP ON FIXED ON
* Fix /window kill to not kill the last "non-fixed" window
* Fix /window hide to not hide the last "non-fixed" window
* Allow /window kill to kill a "fixed" window, but not the last window.
* (*gulp*) I hope all of the above works!
* Fix $windowctl(REFNUM ...) it was out of order with REFNUMS
* Make /xecho -l override the "who_from" target and always send to the level
* Fix raw listen DCCs not obey /SET DCC_TIMEOUT.
* Added outputting of long long ints to new math parser.
* Add $windowctl(GET <refnum> DOUBLE) 
* Support inbound double quoted filenames in dcc handshakes. bleh.
* Fix NULL deref when you kill hidden windows (ie, /window killswap)
* Update tabkey.jm one last time
* Add 'notify' script, a replacement for the notify command.
* Fix $windowctl(GET <refnum> DOUBLE)
* Make /on window_command give two refnums, the before and after refnums.
* Fix the larneproofing in numeric_handler(), it was defective all over.
* Fix a NULL deref if you do /window when there is no current window (!)
* Update notify script from nsx, add sping script from nsx.
* More script changes from nsx.  Gotta ask him to stop this. :d
* Another round of minor compiler nits.  Nothing worth fretting over.
* Fix a couple of minor compiler nits.
* Add /SET STATUS_NOSWAP
* Fix #define DEBUG_EXTRACTW_DEBUG/LASTLOG
* Add -o and -O command line options to turn off IEXTEN termio() options
* Add /WINDOW SWAPPABLE (defaults to on)
* Add %{1}W status expando, expands to /SET STATUS_NOSWAP if SWAPPABLE OFF
* Don't allow windows to be swapped in or out if SWAPPABLE OFF
* Don't allow windows to be shown or hidden if SWAPPABLE OFF
* Do allow windows to be swapped in with WINDOW KILL even if SWAPPABLE OFF
* Add $windowctl(GET <refnum> SWAPPABLE)
* Fix /window next, /window prev (SWAP_NEXT_WINDOW/SWAP_PREV_WINDOW) to 
  skip non-swappable windows.
* Fix /window kill so it doesn't swap in a window too early.
* Make NOTICEs from servers to channels (on ircnet) go to that channel's win.
* Tell getopt about -o and -O
* Fix bounds error in /exec -direct
* The last argument to open_file_for_write() needs to be lowercase.
* Add $numlines() from fudd.
* Fix some issues with $numlines()
* Fix DCC events so that they occur in the context of "no server" (FROMSERV)
  rather than the "current server" (NOSERV).  This can fix or completely break
  certain intermittent scripting problems.
* Fixed {f,}q1cmd in commandqueues so that it works properly in the "no server"
  context.
* Make the output-window-searcher ignore from_server for LOG_DCC
* Make status_hold and status_hold_lines use scrollback numbers too.
* Make add_to_scrollback() redraw status bar if output while scrollbacking.
* Do not increment arg_count when ignoring an empty argument in arglists.
* Add /ON WINDOW_BEFOREKILL
* Another iteration of the 'notify' script, hooks the system's /ONs now! =)
* Put a space in place of a newline in the PF loader.
* Always ignore spaces after semicolons in parse_line (the {} parser).
* Some compiler warning fixes from rain.
* Fix defects and a memory leak in the pf loader.
* Fixes to 'less' script from howl
* New 'help' script from howl
* Add /WINDOW SCROLLADJ.
* Make inet_vhostsockaddr() extern so dcc can use it
* Make dcc_open() use inet_vhostsockaddr() to bind /hostname to dcc conns
* Don't allow -b and -q, or -b -and -s, as they cause deadlocks/panics
* Fix casting error that caused $urlencode() of high bit chars to segfault
* If swapping in a window that has no room for double status, recalculate all
* If double-on in a window that has no room for it, recalculate all
* Fix for rain's meta-compat script
* Change default of /SET AUTO_REJOIN to OFF.
