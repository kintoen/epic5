EPIC4 Projects, Bugs, and other Errata:

KNOWN ERRATA (eg, bugs, or unresolved requests):
------------------------------------------------
* A missing 'else' in create_additional_screen causes gnu screen to be
  prefered over X windows.  Should this be fixed, or at least made an option?
  Maybe try X, fall back to gnu screen on failure?
* You can't unset environment variables.
