EPIC4 Projects, Bugs, and other Errata:

KNOWN ERRATA (eg, bugs, or unresolved requests):
------------------------------------------------
* A missing 'else' in create_additional_screen causes gnu screen to be
  prefered over X windows.  Should this be fixed, or at least made an option?
  Maybe try X, fall back to gnu screen on failure?
* Should /set beep off suppress stripping of beeps?
* /TYPE honors keybindings, and calls edit_char(), but /XTYPE -L does not 
  honor key bindings because it calls input_add_character().
* Study update_input() and update_all_windows() and determine if used properly
* Shall remove_trailing_spaces honor a \ before a space trailing?
* Some way to color the input prompt?

THE CHANGELOG SINCE THE LAST RELEASE:
-------------------------------------
* New /set, /SET SWITCH_CHANNELS_BETWEEN_WINDOWS
* C language issues (const correctness, integer size correctness)
* Revamp channel structure to hold window refnum and not window pointer
* Add "current channel counter" to channel structure.
* Determine "current channel" by election.
* Garbage collect a lot of now unnecessary code.
* Add get_echannel_by_refnum(), returns window's "elected" current channel
* Add internal function is_waiting_for_channel()
* Add internal function move_waiting_channel()
* Add internal function get_winref_by_bound_channel()
* Add internal function get_bound_channel_by_refnum()
* Convert uses of get_channel_by_refnum() to get_echannel_by_refnum()
* Fix $winbound() to work when given a window refnum
* Fix valgrind issue with $regcomp()
* Remove sanity checks from traverse_all_channels(); handled elsewhere now
* Change traverse_all_channels() with "this server" or "not this server" arg
* Nuke (Window *)->current_channel.  Handled by channels now.  HUZZAH!
* Implement /ON SWITCH_WINDOWS again.
* Fix typo in names.h
* Don't use isinf(), it's a bsd-ism, use !finite() instead.
* Don't hold elections for illegal window refnums.
* Channel can't be current if it's not in a window.
* Fix status_voice().
* Fix $stat() so that it expands ~ correctly.
* Fix ctcp over dcc to not coredump.
* Fix dcc over dcc to not coredump.  (different issue)
* Add %{1}+ as a special favor to howl.
* Convert all uses of strcpy() to strlcpy()
* Convert all uses of strcat() to strlcat()
* Convert all uses of strmcpy() to strlcpy()
* Convert all uses of strmcat() to strlcat()
* Convert all uses of sprintf() to snprintf()
* As much as possible, use 'sizeof var' in snprintf/strlcpy/strlcat.
* Qualify the size of some global vars so we can sizeof() them.
* Nuke strmcpy(), strmcat(), strmcat_ue(), strmccat(),
* Change strmopencat() to strlopencat().
* Change strmpcat() to strlpcat().
* Fix switch_hostname so it doesn't return a (const) string.
* Fix TimerTimeout so it doesn't return a (const) Timeval.
* Change things like (ret) to do ret while (0); for when "ret" is "{}".
* Fix initialization for load_level
* Stop passing in static strings into io(), so we can modify them.
* Make messages passed to io() more informative to the user.
* Fix CTCP FINGER handler not to assume (struct pw) strings can be overwritten.
* Use (socklen_t) and not an (int) for socket sizes.
* Don't return a value in a void function...
* Don't use return value of process_dcc_chat_ctcps() for assignment.
* Don't put semicolons after function bodies
* Fix $getopt() to save 'input_size' so we can use it with strl*().
* Convert all uses of stpcpy() to strlcat() and strlopencat().
* Nix checks for stpcpy() in configure -- regen configure.
* Include strlcpy() in wserv.c for use by gailib.c.
* Fixed $prefix() to not return one more char than it should.
* Added a $prefix() regression test.
* Aesthetic change to /exec pipe cleanups.
* Changed nick rolling at 9/NICKLEN chars to distinguish the two more sensibly.
* Move /DCC from commands.c to dcc.c
* Nix the "dcc deadlist" crap.  Handle deleted dcc's more sensibly now.
* Add a "dequote" internal function that removes "s in extended words.
* Add "QWORDS" as new arglist type, for quoted-words with "s left in.
* Add "arglist" regression test.
* Fix strlcpy() in compat.c so it doesn't walk off end of string.
* Implement more sensible "locking" mechanism for dcc's
* Nix the nominally unimplemented "encrypt" feature for dcc
* Create "dcc_create" to create dcc entry
* Remove "creation" functionality from "dcc_searchlist"
* Nix global variables 'filesize' and 'global_family' now unneeded.
* Change order around of arguments to "dcc_searchlist".
* Rename "dcc_opened" to "dcc_connected" since that is what it does.
* Add "dcc_garbage_collect" which looks for dcc's that need removal.
* Add "get_dcc_by_filedesc" and "get_dcc_by_refnum" to look up dcc's
* Add "lock_dcc" and "unlock_dcc" to prevent dcc's from being GC'd.
* Double check that all output that occurs in dcc.c goes to LOG_DCC
* Use dcc_open in dcc_raw_listen() instead of doing the network stuff directly.
* Allow "booster ctcp" to be sent for dcc chat re-offerings.
* Reorganize register_dcc_offer() so it doesn't create dcc until all is well.
* Reorganize process_outgoing_file() into sub-functions.
* Don't call "dcc_dead" or "dcc_check" in main io() looper.
* Fix new_next_arg_count() to use real_move_to_abs_word() to emulate $1 usage
* Fix infinite recursion bug when a channel key contains unmatched (
* Add $outputinfo() which outputs "level" and "target".
* Add $levelwindow() which returns window refnum for a given level.
