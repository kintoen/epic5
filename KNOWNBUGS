EPIC4 Projects, Bugs, and other Errata:

KNOWN ERRATA (eg, bugs, or unresolved requests):
------------------------------------------------
* A missing 'else' in create_additional_screen causes gnu screen to be
  prefered over X windows.  Should this be fixed, or at least made an option?
  Maybe try X, fall back to gnu screen on failure?
* Should /set beep off suppress stripping of beeps?
* Allegedly 464 numeric shouldn't force a reconnect if we're registered.
* The mangler might expand things more than 3 times -- possible
  interference from the attribute parser?  caused by many ^v's.
 
[See http://www.epicsol.org/PROJECTS for things to come in the future]
[See http://www.epicsol.org/CHANGELOG for things that changed in the past]

THE CHANGELOG SINCE THE LAST RELEASE:
-------------------------------------
* Add $killpid() as a favor for Liandrin.
* Really fix wserv this time.
* Add GETADDR_DOES_NOT_DO_AF_UNIX for KAME, which doesn't do AF_UNIX
* Change dcc_raw_connect() to take a string port, not integer
* Add LocalIPv6Addr, for IPv6 virtual hostnames
* Include <sys/stat.h> in irc_std.h.  Clean up elsewhere later.
* Add a bunch of typedefs for IPv6 and stuff.
* Change inet_anyton() to take a port string
* Change connectory() to take a port string, not a number.
* Change my_accept() to Accept()
* Add wrappers for getaddrinfo()/freeaddrinfo(), with first letter in caps.
* Decouple wserv4 from network.c.  Now can do yell() and malloc() in network.c.
* Rip a lot of k-rap out of wserv.c that was there only for network.c
* Add connectory() (such as it is) to wserv.c.
* Change all uses of 'hostname' (a global variable) to 'host'
* Rewrite switch_hostname() to use getaddrinfo() and support IPv6 for virthosts
* Change LocalIPv4Addr/LocalIPv6Addr to pointers, manage in switch_hostname()
* Remove now unused resolv() function.
* Change inet_remotesockaddr() to take a port string, not a number.
* Add IPv6 p-addr support to connectory().  Hostnames still default to IPv4.
* "EPIC_USE_HIGHPORTS" only works for IPv4 now.
* Support IPv6 virtual hosts in inet_vhostsockaddr()
* Add IPv6 support to inet_remotesockaddr()
* Push AF_UNIX support in inet_remotesockaddr() off to Getaddrinfo().
* Convert inet_anyton() to use Getaddrinfo(), which adds IPv6 support.
* Add some comments to help me in the future.
