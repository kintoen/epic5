EPIC4 Projects, Bugs, and other Errata:

KNOWN ERRATA (eg, bugs, or unresolved requests):
------------------------------------------------
* /dcc chat hop from an ipv6 server connection will default to ipv4 bind(),
  but send out an ipv6 address in the handshake. (send_booster_ctcp doesn't
  check what protocol get_server_local_address() returns.)

[See http://www.epicsol.org/PROJECTS for things to come in the future]
[See http://www.epicsol.org/CHANGELOG for things that changed in the past]

THE CHANGELOG SINCE THE LAST RELEASE:
-------------------------------------
* Allow $serverctl(SET <refnum> UMODES) to work around ratbox-1.2-3.
* Work around "(brown paper bag release)" version in 004 in ratbox-1.2-3
* Use the server's message in our default 330 output.
* Make $numwords() use count_words() as a test.  Looks ok so far...
* Make $indextoword() use count_words().
* Implement regression tests for $indextoword()
* Any further problems with $indextoword() should add regress tests!
* Make epic behave like ircII when doing /window create with screen and X.
* Make move_to_next_word() stop when it hits a trailing nul, duh!
* Add /set wserv_type, either "xterm" or "screen".
* Add malloc_strcat_word_c, add a single word to word list, with "" support
* Convert a bunch of stuff to use malloc_strcat_word_c to honor ""s right.
* GC a bunch of unused code.
* Add /on dcc_activity, to allow scripters a way around %D.
* Nix the never valid network error code -15 (duplicate of -6)
* Sanity check the family in a dcc handshake against the bind before sending it.
