EPIC4 Projects, Bugs, and other Errata:

KNOWN ERRATA (eg, bugs, or unresolved requests):
------------------------------------------------
* A missing 'else' in create_additional_screen causes gnu screen to be
  prefered over X windows.  Should this be fixed, or at least made an option?
  Maybe try X, fall back to gnu screen on failure?
 
[See http://www.epicsol.org/PROJECTS for things to come in the future]
[See http://www.epicsol.org/CHANGELOG for things that changed in the past]

THE CHANGELOG SINCE THE LAST RELEASE:
-------------------------------------
* Add $fskip(), $fseek(), $frewind(), $ferror() and $isfilevalid().
* Gid rid of the awful bsd_*env() hacks in compat.c.
* Start using getenv() and setenv() like normal programs do.
* Fix /setenv so you can unset env variables with /setenv -VARNAME
* "Ooops"  I didn't sort fskip/fseek/frewind/ferror in the functions list.
