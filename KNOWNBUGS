EPIC4 Projects, Bugs, and other Errata:

KNOWN ERRATA (eg, bugs, or unresolved requests):
------------------------------------------------
* A missing 'else' in create_additional_screen causes gnu screen to be
  prefered over X windows.  Should this be fixed, or at least made an option?
  Maybe try X, fall back to gnu screen on failure?
* Should /set beep off suppress stripping of beeps?
* /TYPE honors keybindings, and calls edit_char(), but /XTYPE -L does not 
  honor key bindings because it calls input_add_character().
* Study update_input() and update_all_windows() and determine if used properly
* Shall remove_trailing_spaces honor a \ before a space trailing?
* Some way to color the input prompt?  (Probably not)
