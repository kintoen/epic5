EPIC4 Projects, Bugs, and other Errata:

KNOWN ERRATA (eg, bugs, or unresolved requests):
------------------------------------------------
* When you do /server <refnum> from a disconnected state, it does not
  honor server groups.
* A lot of dcc output goes to target NULL when there is a nickname available.

[See http://www.epicsol.org/PROJECTS for things to come in the future]
[See http://www.epicsol.org/CHANGELOG for things that changed in the past]

THE CHANGELOG SINCE THE LAST RELEASE:
-------------------------------------
* Allow $serverctl(SET <refnum> UMODES) to work around ratbox-1.2-3.
* Work around "(brown paper bag release)" version in 004 in ratbox-1.2-3
* Use the server's message in our default 330 output.
* Make $numwords() use count_words() as a test.  Looks ok so far...
* Make $indextoword() use count_words().
* Implement regression tests for $indextoword()
* Any further problems with $indextoword() should add regress tests!
* Make epic behave like ircII when doing /window create with screen and X.
* Make move_to_next_word() stop when it hits a trailing nul, duh!
* Add /set wserv_type, either "xterm" or "screen".
* Add malloc_strcat_word_c, add a single word to word list, with "" support
* Convert a bunch of stuff to use malloc_strcat_word_c to honor ""s right.
* GC a bunch of unused code.
* Add /on dcc_activity, to allow scripters a way around %D.
* Nix the never valid network error code -15 (duplicate of -6)
* Sanity check the family in a dcc handshake against the bind before sending it.
* Add /who -operspy for hybrid opers.
* Cleaned data_array and data_struct code and structure up a bit.
* Added more hook protection to the debug.irc script.
* Fixed bug in tabkey.ce where recursion wouldn't work in the middle of a line.
* Also made it possible to tab complete /help without having to tab complete
  any of the previous words.  This _may_ not work on all operating systems.
* Added the INTFUNC define alongside INTTYPE in expr2.c.
* Made setting notify_interval and mail_interval update the system timer.  I
  needed the first one, and did the second one for completeness.
* Fixed "/exec -line {} %pid" so that the exec hooks are called again.
* Fix panic with $joinstr()
* Fix compiler warning comparing pointer against integer
* Fix word appender to NOT USE DOUBLE QUOTES if /xdebug extractw is off!
* Fix the word appender so it actually works right.
* Fix urldecode
* /lastlog -msgs 3 is obliged to skip back 3 msgs, not just 3 lastlog entries.
* Fix warnings in gailib.h
* Fix some const correctness issues
* Make message_to() take an (int) and not (unsigned) so we can pass in -1.
* Fix some arglist regression tests to reflect new extractw semantics.
* Fix uninitialized variable in ok_to_output() that caused panics.
