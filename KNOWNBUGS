EPIC4 Projects, Bugs, and other Errata:

KNOWN ERRATA (eg, bugs, or unresolved requests):
------------------------------------------------
* A missing 'else' in create_additional_screen causes gnu screen to be
  prefered over X windows.  Should this be fixed, or at least made an option?
  Maybe try X, fall back to gnu screen on failure?
* Should /set beep off suppress stripping of beeps?
* Allegedly 464 numeric shouldn't force a reconnect if we're registered.
* The mangler might expand things more than 3 times -- possible
  interference from the attribute parser?  caused by many ^v's.
* Add /timer -delete_for_window or something to avoid window switch warnings?
* After calling connectory(), try to output meaningful error messages, not 
  just blindly calling my_strerror(errno).
* scrollback/scrollforward/scrollend should be controlled by /window verbs
  and not solely by keybindings.
* /TYPE honors keybindings, and calls edit_char(), but /XTYPE -L does not 
  honor key bindings because it calls input_add_character().
* /DEFER needs to be server-specific.
* The check for "sun_len" in <sys/un.h> is bogus and unnecessary since we
  can just use #ifdef HAVE_SA_LEN for that.
* Input cursor wigs out if 2ndary window is < 32 columns wide...
* ^C,,, eats up all commas, not just the first one.
* Join #foo, then join #foobar, doesn't WHO for #foobar (maxxx)
* Built in functions need to call 'parse_server_index'!
* Study update_input() and update_all_windows() and determine if used properly
* Change AC_ARG_WITH(ipv6, to AC_ARG_USING(ipv6,
<larne> AC_ARG_ENABLE(protocols, 
<larne> [  --enable-protocols=protocol[[,protocol...]] Select which protocols
+to support [[default: all]].], 
<larne> [ protocols=$enableval ], 
<larne> [ protocols=$defaultprots ]) 
* DCC send yourself a file and then DCC get it leads to wackiness
* New function, you give it a window level, it gives you the window refnum
* IPV6-over-dcc, i promised morty i would.
* Add a script to implement /set suppress_server_motd.  Someone missed it. doh!
* ON WHO hook not thrown in correct window.

[See http://www.epicsol.org/CHANGELOG for things that changed in the past]

THE CHANGELOG SINCE THE LAST RELEASE:
-------------------------------------

* Fix build error on non-SSL systems.
* Fix another build error on non-SSL systems.
* Fix all the rest of the build errors now that I am able to.
* Add support for channel mode +C at request of quakenet user.
* /exec, /redir, $xdebug tuned as per UPDATES.
* /set FLOATING_POINT_PRECISION added as per UPDATES.
* next_in_comma_list converted to next_in_div_list, div argument added.
* Change default FLOATING_POINT_PRECISION from 6 to 16 which fixes a math bug.
* Add arg to next_args and new_next args to get a certain number of words
* Rewrite /alias xxx (args) handling to use next_args_count and not extractw.
* Tuned the call.xtrace alias in debug.irc.
* Extended $is_on() in guh to allow and return multiple arguments.
* Added $is_off() as a compliment to $is_on().
* Don't count first incoming line as part of the flood when calcing rate.
* Add -l<tcl> to the front of $LIBS so -lm can come after it
* Look for SSL stuff in default location before hunting for it in /usr/local.
* Reset $withval after check for perl so --without-perl doesn't --without-tcl
* Make first arg of cvtchar() a (const char *) to silence warning.
* Move 'this_sucks' label to a place where it is legal.
* Make check_val() cope with NaNs and INFs more graciously...
* Fix null deref with /lastlog -c
* Update the input line in set_update(), not the caller

* Fix bug where <scrollback> + <scrollforward> left you in scrollback mode.
* Force init of Window->lines_held = 0 even though that shouldnt be needed.
* Fix $timerctl() so it actually works (REFNUM/DELETE/GET/SET were broken)
* Fix /TIMER -UPDATE so it doesn't reset events to -1 automatically.
* Fix panic when you /server over from and to a connected server with chans
* Const correctness improvements.
* Invert the meaning of 'new_check_flooding' to return TRUE if flooding.
* Revamp funny.c, /list, /names, /mode reply handling.
* Remove unused joined_nick, public_nick
* Change got_initial_version_28() arguments singly and not an array

* Fix panic when doing stack push set with an empty set stack or 
  stack pop set with a set stack containing items (thanks to Tyrak).
* Fixed ERROR hook to display a star when not connected to a server.
* Tuned internal array consistency checking in regression tests.
* Added some debugging notices to autoget to warn of common problems.
* Uniformly use 32 bit file sizes in dcc.  That's the way it has to be.
* Split process_incoming_chat into modular functions.  It's an experiment.

* Roll /names, /list, and /mode numeric handlers into numbers.c
* Roll "funny" global variables into server-specific variables

* /on window_kill provides two args now, $0 is refnum, $1 is name/refnum.
* Rename "numeric_banner" to "banner"

* In /xecho, rename 'banner' local var to 'want_banner'.
