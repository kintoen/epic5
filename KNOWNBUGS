EPIC5 Projects, Bugs, and other Errata:

KNOWN ERRATA (eg, bugs, or unresolved requests):
------------------------------------------------
* What about scrolling back to some point in time?
* Implement $mask() types 11, 12, and 13
    11           *!*u@h.d                       *!*u@d.*
    12           n!*@h.d                        n!*@d.*
    13           n!*u@h.d                       n!*u@d.*
* Kreca thinks I should have two refnums, one public, one private for windows.
* There needs to be an /on switch_query for wuf/sjhoran
* wuf says that fred!user@machine.domain.com.au should not be
	*!*user@*.com.au but instead *!*user@*.domain.com.au
* Howl would like to retain the /window server <X>  value

ISSUES OF INTEREST
------------------
* The four projects of the UTF8 effort are the primary focus for now.
* Fusion wants /xecho -sec 10 this goes away in 10 seconds

THE CHANGELOG SINCE THE LAST RELEASE:
-------------------------------------
* Patch from twincest to fix build on solaris
* Don't honor queries for WALLOPS (requested by opers)
* Conditionalize <ieeefp.h> per twincest's fix.
* Clear RUBYDOTOH if ruby is found but it isn't usable (rb Zoopee)
* Rewrite checks for (intmax_t) for systems w/o strtoimax(). (rb JailBird)
* Define NSIG as _NSIG or 32 if it's not defined (rb JailBird)
* Broaden what you can specify for the server "proto" field (see UPDATES)
* Fix figure_out_address() to properly identify a server name
* This fixes /ignore user@host.com which was lamely broken.
* Make /window channel output all channels in the window
* Don't call update_all_status() if /set -status_clock (by Oliver Fromme)
* Comment out strtol() compat stuff, causing people problems.
* More graciously handle snprintf() returning -1 (rb twincest)
* Do not use /usr/include/ep on hpux
* Mark lastlog items as "dead" and check for them to avoid dangling ptrs
* Handle (graciously) when /set scroll_lines is > size of the window. (rb CE)
* Properly handle remove_lastlog_item() for the very last item.
* Fixes /eval defer window new kill;defer window new;defer window kill_others
* Add $hookctl(ARGS <recursive> <args>) allows you to replace $* in /on.
* Add $hookctl(USERINFO <recursive> <info>) allows you to set dynamic info.
* Don't lamely malloc_strcpy() over non-malloced strings in hookctl.
* Add $iconvctl() to control iconv stuff. (See UPDATES.)
* Add $xform(iconv +<iconv id>) functionality. (See UPDATES.)
* Fix bug where /window number could lead to confused lastlogs
* Generalize base64 encoding so it doesn't hardcode the base64 string.
* Add $xform(+FISH64 ...) which does FiSH's base64 encoding.
* Make a better test for embedded perl support by calling SvTRUE().
* Fix /bind -defaults so it actually removes all keybindings first. doh.
* Fix /window double so it actually shows you the current double status.
* Make the expression error for too many operands output the expression.
* Rewrite the iconv() configure checks to deal with libiconv's #define's.
* Rewrite the strtoimax() tests so they don't fail lamely to detect (intmax_t)
* Rewrite the perl and ruby runtime configure tests so they work right with gcc
* Fix various warnings revealed by gcc warnings
* Make a very preliminary attempt to write some fish decoding stuff. Not Ready!
* Fix for configure to handle perl's non-existance (kreca)
* Fix wserv4 dependencies so you can do make -j4 on multi-cpu.
* Rework the ruby checking in configure so it builds on freebsd-7
* Add CTCP FISH support (this is _not_ fish support!), see UPDATES
* Make an initial stab at proper support for FiSH's base64 converter.
* I took the "fish64" entry out of $xform() for now while it's broken.
* Capture stdout of ruby scripts and send it to an epic window. yay!
* This means you can do regular old 'puts' in ruby script and it'll Just Work.
* Finish $xform() for +fish64 and -fish64, verified against actual FiSH code
* Try to make the perl configure check more robust for non-working perls.
* Start a project to convert things to use transform_string().
* Fix show_lastlog() to return the rewritten result (so -mangle works)
* Actually de-orbit [en|de]code().
* Create transform_string_dyn, a pleasant api in front of transform_string.
* Create a bunch of global vars for transform_string to avoid lookups.
* Add hints to how big destination buffers should be for xforming.
* Fix transforms by initializing the expander and overhead items.
* Make various sanity checks for transforms to fix amn.
* Ensure all the users of transform_string_dyn are prepared to handle NULLs
* Ensure all the xform encoder/decoders can handle zero dest buffer sizes
* Add code to configure to fail if OpenSSL is not found.  No turning back!
* Split the notion of "iv size" and "blocksize" in crypto support
* This is needed because FiSH does not use an IV, being an ECB cipher
* It's also needed because the notion that the IV *must* be blocksize is lame.
* Add notion of "trimmable bytes" to end of crypto message
* Again, this is for FiSH, because it doesn't trim bytes on last packet.
* Support for assissting valgrind in helping us find memory leaks (caf)
* Fix memory leaks found by valgrind (caf)
* GC function_[en|de]code() and function_sha256 (superceded by $xform())
* GC unused [en|de]code(), enquote_it, dequote_it, and dequote_buffer().
* Fix display calcs when adding 1st window to 1st screen
* This allows you to change 'status.number' for default # of status lines
* Start tracking timestamps for scrollback items
* Full generalization of scrollback/scrollforward functions
* Implement scrollback/forward based on lines
* Implement scrollback/forward based on regex
* Begin thinking about implementing scrollback/forward based on time (not done)
* Windows that are hidden from birth have a fake height of 24 lines
* This fixes a bug where doing /window double on hold_slider 0 in a 
  never-visible window caused it to get stuck in an infinite loop.
* Add new scripts, "help.irc", "history.rb", "locale", and "tabkey.sjh"
* I need to document these in UPDATE!
* Add /exec -closeout, to send EOF to the exec'd process
* Add $dccctl(FD_TO_REFNUM <fd>) to convert $connect() to a refnum for dccctl.
* Remember $dccctl(GET refnum WRITABLE) detects a connected socket, by rule
* Change /on 322 handler so output always goes to OTHER, not to the window.
* Add an /on switch_query, but it's incomplete, so don't use it yet.
* Don't test for /usr/local/lib/libiconv.a because os x doesn't have it
* Prototype malloc_vsnprintf().
