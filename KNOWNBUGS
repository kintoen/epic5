EPIC5 Projects, Bugs, and other Errata:

KNOWN ERRATA (eg, bugs, or unresolved requests):
------------------------------------------------
* displayble_unival() returns 1 if unicode val is displayable, 0 if not.
  - Used in input_do_calculate_width()
  - Used in update_input() [ugh]
* calc_unival_width() returns number of columns a unicode val takes up.
* calc_unival_length() returns number of bytes a unicode sequence takes up.
* calc_unival() converts unicode sequence into an (unsigned)
* utf8_sequence() converts an (unsigned) into a unicode sequence.
* mbdata_init() loads an mb_data with an iconv dataset.
* mbdata_done() unloads an mb_data.
* decode_mb() converts "anything" into utf-8 using an mb_data.
  - Used in input.c:set_input()
  - Used in input.c:set_input_prompt()
  - Used in screen.c:my_strlen_i() [string width counter]
  - Used in screen.c:split_up_line() to count non-attribute chars.
* Some way to call an alias in a variable indirectly

LOOK FOR IN THE FUTURE
-----------------------
* Output rules
* Support for CNOTICE
* More gracious support for trickling horizontal resizes down to the window.
* /window <refnum> noserv causes bad fd loop.  (can't reproduce?)
* Is there some way to set what ^O resets to, a la mirc?
* /CTCPs over /DCCs don't match up with their queries very well.
* $xform()s for SED and DEF
* str_to_mask() should be silent, callers should be warning.
* Add /window indent, to overrule /set indent.
* A way to control what counts as a space on the fly (via a /set?)
* Handling keypresses should overrule protocol enforcement (on_notice, etc)
* Support for 64 bit ints could be more widespread

[See http://www.epicsol.org/PROJECTS for things to come in the future]
[See http://www.epicsol.org/CHANGELOG5 for things that changed in the past]

THE CHANGELOG SINCE THE LAST RELEASE:
-------------------------------------
* Make GET_INT_ARG() support 64 bit ints, for future use
* Make $fseek() support 64 bit file offsets (yay!)
* Begin converting some time_t uses over to 64 bits, Just In Case
* Make $numsort(), $strtol(), $tobase() support 64 bit ints.
* Make $stat() support 64 bit ints where possible.
* Add 'channelmonitor' script from larne.  Thanks!
