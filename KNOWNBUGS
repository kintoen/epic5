EPIC5 Projects, Bugs, and other Errata:

KNOWN ERRATA (eg, bugs, or unresolved requests):
------------------------------------------------
* /on dcc_lost should be thrown in more places, when DCC_DELETE is set.

LOOK FOR IN THE FUTURE
-----------------------
* Some way to alert the user when the bind() of a dcc failed (because the
  port is in use?)
* Finish refactoring the input prompt, by showing the prompt all the time,
  eliminating one-column-per-byte assumption.
* There is confusion between "proto" "type" and "addrfamily" with server
  stuff.  Normalize and redocument.
* send_text() needs rework, to add extra /on's so you can flag those special. 
* Lastlog improvements (unified lastlog, refnums, moving between windows, etc)
* Import utf8 support from ircII OR add support for utf16 (wide chars)
* Import fg/bg color support from ircII 
* 8-bit color support (256 colors for xterm) (rb larne)
* Improvements for LOAD_PATH; directories, zip files, filename caching.
* UPnP support via http://miniupnp.free.fr/
* Some way to call an alias in a variable indirectly
* Output rules
* Support for CNOTICE
* /CTCPs over /DCCs don't match up with their queries very well. (nullie)
* $xform()s for SED and DEF
* str_to_mask() should be silent, callers should be warning.
* Support for 64 bit ints could be more widespread
* Larne wants suppression of duplicated lines (like syslog maybe?)
* Larne and nullie say that stdout can block when running under screen
* Refactor hardcoded uses of select() so select() isn't mandatory.
* Nullie wants a way to do themed sends, such that
	/ctcp ...   is themed, and /^ctcp .. is unthemed
* Shattah would like something like /window omit <regex> to remove stuff.

[See http://www.epicsol.org/CHANGELOG5 for things that changed in the past]

THE CHANGELOG SINCE THE LAST RELEASE:
-------------------------------------
* Change 'wserv4' to 'epic5-wserv4' to avoid conflicting with epic4.
* Fix output of /disconnect when disconnected to be less confusing.
* Some changes to tabkey.jm to see if we can get it working.
* Move some functions out of input.c to better places.
