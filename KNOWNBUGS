EPIC5 Projects, Bugs, and other Errata:

KNOWN ERRATA (eg, bugs, or unresolved requests):
------------------------------------------------
* Support $HOME with spaces in it for cygwin.
* Howl wants to specify a minimum number of lines before (Held: ) shows.
  - "(Held)" should be displayed until it hits /window hold_interval
* Twincest wants a way to be able to change a dcc's alternate filename
<twincest> hop: my exact request was that spaces in the filename should be
+encoded to _ instead of %20, for readability 
<twincest> hop: but it seems that that would best be implemented on top of
+some more general system 

ISSUES OF INTEREST
------------------
* Now that $xform() is mature, we can script many things:
    encode decode urlencode urldecode b64encode b64decode sedcrypt sha256
* Rewrite the input prompt to use a linked list instead of a C string.
* Normalize 'proto', 'type', and 'addrfamily' values with server stuff.
* There should be an /on send_encrypted_msg, /on send_encrypted_public, etc.
* All lastlogs for all windows should be stored in one big list
* You should be able to move lastlog items between windows, split, merge.
* Everybody wants utf8 support -- but who will volunteer to help me?
* IRCII supports "default" fg/bg colors, which looks intriguing.
* Larne would like to use 256-color-support for xterm.
* I would like to be able to /load zip files and put them into LOAD_PATH.
* UPnP support (http://miniupnp.free.fr) would fix dcc-behind-firewall dilema.
* If @ var = [encode] you should be able to do $($var)(args) to call it.
* Output rules
* Undernet's CPRIVMSG and CNOTICE allow chanops to msg members w/o penalty
* /CTCPs over /DCCs don't match up with their queries very well. (nullie)
* str_to_mask() should be silent, callers should be warning.
* Support for 64 bit ints could be more widespread
* Larne wants suppression of duplicated lines (like syslog maybe?)
* Remove all the hardcoded uses of select() so it isn't mandatory.
* Shattah would like something like /window omit <regex> to remove stuff.
* Kanan wants support for jabber
* Zlonix wants a way to be notified when window geometry changes
* Zlonix would like me to commit his /on signal patch
* Zlonix would like per-screen toplines

[See http://www.epicsol.org/CHANGELOG5 for things that changed in the past]

THE CHANGELOG SINCE THE LAST RELEASE:
-------------------------------------

* Make update_input() take a screen as an argument, to update one screen only.
* Make /window create screen's input lines work again (rb kitambi)
* Fix crash from /parsekey type_text

* When doing /stack pop set ... the callback (if any) should be invoked.
* Add a server param to what_channel() so i can use it in send_text() later.

* Add the ** unary operator -- double expand.  See UPDATES
* Comment what I'm going to mangle xform into.

* Add $xform() handlers for blowfish and cast5
* Whip the $xform() callback functions into usable shape.
* Fix base64 encoding both via $xform() and $b64encode().
* Rewrite $xform(), see UPDATES.  Strong crypto now supported! YAY!
* Allow encryption $xform() handlers to reformat their keys, so we can...

* Fix hookctl(set list ... implied {...}) to work as intended (rb zlonix)
* Add $windowctl(GET refnum CHANNELS) (rb Black)

* Fix various other issues that valgrind found (yay!)
* Commit a 'url.irc' script that I don't know where it came from...
* Apparantly solaris 9 doesn't have <stdint.h>, intmax_t, or strtoimax. ick.
