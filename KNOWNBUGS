EPIC5 Projects, Bugs, and other Errata:

KNOWN ERRATA (eg, bugs, or unresolved requests):
------------------------------------------------
* What about scrolling back to some point in time?
* Implement $mask() types 11, 12, and 13
    11           *!*u@h.d                       *!*u@d.*
    12           n!*@h.d                        n!*@d.*
    13           n!*u@h.d                       n!*u@d.*
* /on 322 (LIST reply) requires special handling for message_from(NULL, ...);
* Kreca thinks I should have two refnums, one public, one private for windows.
* <CrazyEddy> Hey hop, another bug report:  This eventually locks up in the loop
+at line 5510 of window.c:  /timer -rep -1 1 /window new double on hold_slider
+0 hide_others 
* The FiSH cipher will be EVP_bf_ecb(void) with an SHA256 key.
  (FiSH == BLOWFISH_ECB_SHA)
* FiSH64 doesn't actually do a streaming base64, 
  Whereas base64 digits hold 6 bits of information, making a sync point 
  every 24 bits (3 bytes), FiSH has an additional sync point at 32 bits
  (in the middle of the 6th digit) and then starts a new 7th digit at
  bit 33.
                            1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 
	0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
        |--b64-1--| |--b64-2--| |--b64-3--| |--b64-4--| |--b64-5--| |--b64-6
  Whereas Base64 does 3 bytes -> 4 bytes
  FiSH64 does 6 digits (48 bits) -> 4 raw bytes (32 bits), twice

ISSUES OF INTEREST
------------------
* The four projects of the UTF8 effort are the primary focus for now.

[See http://www.epicsol.org/PROJECTS for things to come in the future]
[See http://www.epicsol.org/CHANGELOG5 for things that changed in the past]

THE CHANGELOG SINCE THE LAST RELEASE:
-------------------------------------
* Patch from twincest to fix build on solaris
* Don't honor queries for WALLOPS (requested by opers)
* Conditionalize <ieeefp.h> per twincest's fix.
* Clear RUBYDOTOH if ruby is found but it isn't usable (rb Zoopee)
* Rewrite checks for (intmax_t) for systems w/o strtoimax(). (rb JailBird)
* Define NSIG as _NSIG or 32 if it's not defined (rb JailBird)
* Broaden what you can specify for the server "proto" field (see UPDATES)
* Fix figure_out_address() to properly identify a server name
* This fixes /ignore user@host.com which was lamely broken.
* Make /window channel output all channels in the window
* Don't call update_all_status() if /set -status_clock (by Oliver Fromme)
* Comment out strtol() compat stuff, causing people problems.
* More graciously handle snprintf() returning -1 (rb twincest)
* Do not use /usr/include/ep on hpux
* Mark lastlog items as "dead" and check for them to avoid dangling ptrs
* Handle (graciously) when /set scroll_lines is > size of the window. (rb CE)
* Properly handle remove_lastlog_item() for the very last item.
* Fixes /eval defer window new kill;defer window new;defer window kill_others
* Add $hookctl(ARGS <recursive> <args>) allows you to replace $* in /on.
* Add $hookctl(USERINFO <recursive> <info>) allows you to set dynamic info.
* Don't lamely malloc_strcpy() over non-malloced strings in hookctl.
* Add $iconvctl() to control iconv stuff. (See UPDATES.)
* Add $xform(iconv +<iconv id>) functionality. (See UPDATES.)
* Fix bug where /window number could lead to confused lastlogs
* Generalize base64 encoding so it doesn't hardcode the base64 string.
* Add $xform(+FISH64 ...) which does FiSH's base64 encoding.
* Make a better test for embedded perl support by calling SvTRUE().
* Fix /bind -defaults so it actually removes all keybindings first. doh.
* Fix /window double so it actually shows you the current double status.
* Make the expression error for too many operands output the expression.
* Rewrite the iconv() configure checks to deal with libiconv's #define's.
* Rewrite the strtoimax() tests so they don't fail lamely to detect (intmax_t)
* Rewrite the perl and ruby runtime configure tests so they work right with gcc
* Fix various warnings revealed by gcc warnings
* Make a very preliminary attempt to write some fish decoding stuff. Not Ready!
