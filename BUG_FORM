If you should see what you think to be a bug, please fill out
this form and send to the following address(es):

		list@epicsol.org

And we will try to get back to you as soon as we can, and will
correct the bug if it is at all possible.


Please remember when reporting a bug that information counts.  Since
we have not yet mastered the skill of mind-reading, you should not
assume that we know anything about your situation.  We have seen some 
things that look absolutely strange to us, but are perfectly normal 
to the user. It is best for you to take the stance that we dont know 
that much about your operating system, so you should try to start at 
the beginning and clue us in.  Thanks a bunch. |8^)


Question one:  Please describe your computer system
	Hardware type?
	Operating System? (try uname -a for most, or uname -X for SCO)
	Your compiler (include version, if known)
	What scripts/script packs you run (phoenix, uus, superpack, etc)
	Anything else you think might be helpful.

Question two:  Where does your problem occur?
	[ ]  Configure time (dies while running configure)
	[ ]  Compiler time (dies when you type 'make')
	[ ]  Run time (You got a "CRITICAL PROTECTION ERROR")
	[ ]  Run time (You got a "PANIC" message)
	[ ]  Run time (non-fatal logic bug)

If it is configure time, please include a cut and paste of everything
that appears on your screen from the line when you type "./configure"
until you see your prompt again.  Please do not leave out any
lines, for any line may contain very important information!


If it is at compile time, please include a cut and paste of
everything that appears on your screen from the line when you 
type 'make' until you see your prompt again.  Please do not leave
out any lines, for any line may contain very important information!


If it is at run time, please try to describe as best you can what
you were doing when the client malfunctioned.  Had you just run 
a command?  Can you duplicate the error?  What seems to cause the
error in your best judgement?  Have you found anything else
that independantly causes this same problem?

If you know how to use a debugger, it would be helpful if you 
can get a stack trace, and cut and paste it here.




Please include any other information that you think we should know about.





Thank you for taking the time to fill this out.  We hope that this form
will make finding and fixing bugs much less of a headache for both
us and you.  We will reply to you as soon as possible (probably the next
school day), and we will let you know when we've fixed the problem and
give you a patch for it.
