These are wishlist items that people have asked me for.  Maybe someday
someone will think they are interesting and implement them!

ISSUES OF INTEREST
------------------
* Should there be client-side topic caching?
* $listen() should be able to take a vhost/paddr directly
* There should be a function that returns your vhosts.
* Document the wikihelp for lastlog with stuff like -context.
* Re-implement /set cmdchars
* You should be able to /msg @logfile
* You should be able to move lastlog items between windows, split, merge.
* Shattah would like something like /window omit <regex> to remove stuff.
* Rewrite the input prompt to use a linked list instead of a C string.
* There should be a SWITCH_TARGET keybinding
* I would like to be able to /load zip files and put them into LOAD_PATH.
* Normalize 'proto', 'type', and 'addrfamily' values with server stuff.
* Undernet's CPRIVMSG and CNOTICE allow chanops to msg members w/o penalty
* You can't move a window to a different screen atomically (you must hide it)
* Howl wants a temporary hold mode that expires when you reach bottom.
* Everybody wants utf8 support -- but who will volunteer to help me?
* There should be something internally that detects pastes.
* What about pastes with "rogue characters" like ³ (alt-3, ie, ^[3) ?
* The way dcc filenames are handled is bad; you should be able to seamlessly
  rewrite filenames both outbound and inbound.  URL encoding should auto-detect
* There should be an /on send_encrypted_msg, /on send_encrypted_public, etc.
* IRCII supports "default" fg/bg colors, which looks intriguing.
* Larne would like to use 256-color-support for xterm.
  ^[[48;5;<color>m   <color> = 16 + (red * 36) + (green * 6) + blue
* Larne would like a ==== indicator that appears at his last scrollback point.
* Larne wants suppression of duplicated lines (like syslog maybe?)
* Remove all the hardcoded uses of select() so it isn't mandatory.
* Zlonix wants a way to be notified when window geometry changes
* Jm would like an /xdebug inbound type facility for dcc raw connections.
* Jm thinks regex support for /switch would be nice.
* How about base85 support for $xform() ?
* Zlonix would like per-screen toplines
* Output rules
* Pegasus wants a way to send italics (^I)
* Kreca mentions that word manip functions strip extraneous spaces.
* If @ var = [encode] you should be able to do $($var)(args) to call it.
* Krisp wants a log that only logs what is not logged somewhere else.
* UPnP support (http://miniupnp.free.fr) would fix dcc-behind-firewall dilema.
* <twincest> hop: i would like a function that erases the last 10 lines of the
  +display and replaces them with the output of /lastlog 10
  <twincest> (obviously, for any number, not just 10 ;-)
  <twincest> since i use lastlog_rewrite to timestamp the log, that would allow
  +me to insert timestamps without duplicating text
  <twincest> also, i would like a way to temporarily disable window updates
  <twincest> so i can do /window upate off; /lastlog; /window update on
  <twincest> and it outputs the lastlog without me having to wait for the entire
  +thing to be drawn
  <twincest> it would just appear in the scrollback
