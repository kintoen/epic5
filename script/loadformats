#
# Here's the plan...
# We have an input file that looks like this:
#	^TYPE FORMAT...$
# where TYPE is an ON type, and FORMAT is something that can be /echo'd for
# for that of ON.  We want to open up a file, and slurp it into $hookctl().
# 

alias loadformats (filename, void)

	if (index(h $info(O)) == -1) {
		xecho -b Your client doesn't have implied hooks, sorry.
		return
	}

	^local fd,line,type,retval,formats_loaded

	@ fd = open($filename R)
	@ line = read($fd)
	while (!eof($fd))
	{
		@ type = shift(line)
		@ retval = hookctl(SET LIST $type IMPLIED $line)
		if (retval != 1) {
			xecho -b Could not load format: $type $line
		} else {
			@ formats_loaded++;
		}
		@ line = read($fd)
	}

	xecho -b Loaded $formats_loaded formats from $(filename).
	@close($fd)
}
