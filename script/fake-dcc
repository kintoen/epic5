 * Ok.  Here is the plan:
 *
 * We have a variable, $fake_dcc, that contains a list of words that can
 * be substituted for ``DCC'' as a CTCP.
 *
 * The sender randomly picks a word off that list and uses it.
 * The receiver then reparses the handshake if its on his list.
 *
 * Don't be fooled.  This script is not nearly as useful as it
 * might be made to be.  Its just a contrived example.
