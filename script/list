# showlist <list of items>

# Comments:
# This is apparently an intellectual exercise, as this is most certainly
# not the "best" way to do this, by any modern measure.  However, it does
# demonstrate that it is possible to use a counter to iterate through the
# argument list in a useful manner without using recursion of any kind.
