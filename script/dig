# Find the minimum/maximum number. $min(<list>) $max(<list>)

# $commamake(one two three) returns "one,two,three"

# Somewhat kludge function here. This function finds the parent domain
# to given host, rather than using a assumed approach
# e.g. Many would view www.syd.lucid.net.au as being from the domain
# lucid.net.au - when it's parent domain is in fact syd.lucid.net.au
# This function has it's uses, to some more than others.
# requires hop's pipe function, as well as the "dig" program.
# $digdomain(squishycow.syd.lucid.net.au) returns "syd.lucid.net.au"
