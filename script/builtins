#
# Here's the plan
# In epic5-0.0.3, I removed a bunch of built in commands that were actually
# hardcoded aliases.  I have put them here, as user aliases.
#
alias bye {//quit $*}
alias date {//time $*}
alias exit {//quit $*}
alias host {//userhost $*}
alias irchost {//hostname $*}
alias leave {//part $*}
alias signoff {//quit $*}
