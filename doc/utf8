A plan for utf8 support

Project 1: Scripts
  All scripts will be translated into utf8 at /load time.
  All output will be translated from utf8 at display time.
  Column counting is not in the scope of this project.

Project 2: Targets
  All targets (channels and nicknames) shall be maintained in a table
  Each target shall be associated with an encoding
  Strings to and from the target shall be converted to/from utf8

Project 3: Column Counting
  The output code needs to know how to count utf8 strings properly

Project 4: Input handling
  All input shall be converted to utf8 
  The input line needs to know about utf8 strings, 
  Specifically how to count columns.  
  Better handling for utf8 vagaries, specifically OS X's composed characters.
