A plan for utf8 support

Project 1: Scripts (done)
  All scripts will be translated into utf8 at /load time. (done)
  All output will be translated from utf8 at display time. (done)
  Column counting is not in the scope of this project.

Project 2: Targets
  All targets (channels and nicknames) shall be maintained in a table
  Each target shall be associated with an encoding
  Strings to and from the target shall be converted to/from utf8

Project 3: Column Counting  (done)
  The output code needs to know how to count utf8 strings properly (done)
  The output code needs to translate from utf8 to the user's encoding. (done)

Project 4: Input handling (done)
  All input shall be converted to utf8  (done)
  The input line needs to know about utf8 strings, (done)
  Specifically how to count columns.  (done)
  Better handling for utf8 vagaries, specifically OS X's composed characters.
		(done)


Helpful notes provided by people:
<Q_> hop: The console is set with LC_CTYPE.  You can use nl_langinfo(CODESET)
+to convert it to the character encoding. 
<Q_> Please atleast use that when it's available. 

$xform(ICONV "from/to" string) needs to allow optional "from" or "to" to 
translate from or to the user's effective translation w/o the script having
to know what it is.

Adding support for $hookctl(SET HOOK -1 ARGS ....) would allow people to 
rewrite $* for an /on event, which would work great with $xform() to do 
script-level iconv handling.
