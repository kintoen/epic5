If you are actively using and debugging EPIC4 releases, or have contributed
anything to EPIC4, and feel that you should be on this list, drop me a line 
at jnelson@acronet.net.  You qualify for the "Quality Control Engineer" title
if you dilligently test every release of epic4 (no matter how minor) to see 
if it is broken in some manner.  Those who test when they can are "Contributing
Testers".


I wish to thank everyone who has ever contributed at any time to the EPIC
project: Chris Mattingly, Texaco, DeadelviS, murple, TaCo, Edge, Chaos, 
Oldpink, Jos Bakus, aStaroth, flarp, Thumper, Riddler, S_Avatar, Sheik,
