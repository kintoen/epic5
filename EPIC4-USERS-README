If you're upgrading from EPIC4, and you have your own ~/.epicrc (or ~/.ircrc)
file with your own stuff in it, you need to know about these things:

1) Aliases no longer auto-append $*
This sort of alias no longer works:
	alias m msg
Internally, up through epic4, the client would silently rewrite this to:
	alias m {msg $*}
without telling you.  This auto-append feature is not included in epic5, so
your alias is taken literally -- unless there is a $* there, it will not be
appended.  So if you mean to use $* in your alias, you need to put it there.


2) You need to /load global
It used to be that the client unconditionally did a /load global for you
and you couldn't turn that off.  Some people didn't like that, so epic5 does
not unconditionally /load global.

BUT: If you are not using a script, you really do want to load it, and you
will be alarmed at features that don't exist (like command history) if you 
don't load it. 

So put this somewhere in your  ~/.epicrc (or ~/.ircrc)
	load global


3) /XECHO -W to a window that doesn't exist is no longer displayed
It used to be that if you did /XECHO -W to a window that didn't exist the
client would just put your output "wherever".  The client no longer does
this -- if you try to output to a window that doesn't exist, then it will
not output it somewhere else, it will just not output at all.

This is an issue for things like MsgWins, where your script might be doing
something like:
	on ^msg * {xecho -w MsgWin *$0* $1-}
but if you haven't created a window called "MsgWin" then you will never see
your messages.
