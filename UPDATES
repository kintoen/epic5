EPIC4-1.2.0

*** News 09/03/2002 -- New built in command, /LOG, general purpose log files
	General Purpose Log Files work quite a bit like windows, but instead
	of displaying to your screen, they write to a file.

	Each /LOG command works by choosing a logfile, and then performing
	one or more actions upon it -- just like the /WINDOW command.
	However, there is no concept as a "current logfile" so each time you
	use the /LOG command you need to re-specify the log you want to use.

	These are the operations currently supported by /LOG

	Options that modify the log's configuration
	-------------------------------------------
		NEW		
			Create a new logfile to work on.
		REFNUM <name|number>
			Work on the specified log file, using either it's
			name (see below) or its refnum.
		NAME <name>
			Change the logical name of the logfile to <name>.
			You can use <name> in /LOG REFNUM later.
		FILENAME <name>
			Change the filename that this log writes to.  You
			MUST specify a filename before you can turn a log ON!
		TYPE
			Each logfile can log one of three different "types"
			of things; either a list of nicks or channels 
			("TARGETS"), a list of windows ("WINDOWS") or a list
			of servers ("SERVERS").  The default type is TARGETS.
			WARNING!  If you use /LOG TYPE, all of the current
			targets you have added to the log will be destroyed,
			even if you don't change the type!  This is how you 
			can destroy the target list if you want to start over.
		SERVER <server refnum>
			Change the server this logfile belongs to.  By default
			the log belongs to whatever the current server was
			when it was created.  If you use the special server
			refnum -1, then the log works for all servers.

	Options that modify the log's state
	-----------------------------------
		ON
			Turn the logfile on.
		OFF
			Turn the logfile off.

	Options that modify the log's target list
	-----------------------------------------
		ADD <nick|channel|refnum>[,<nick|channel|refnum>...]
			If the log is of "TARGET" type, then add a list of 
			one or more nicks or channels to the current target
			list.  If the log is of "WINDOW" or "SERVER" type,
			then add a list of one or more window or server
			refnums to the list.
		REMOVE <nick|channel>[,<nick|channel>...]
			If the log is of "TARGET" type, then remove a list of 
			one or more nicks or channels to the current target
			list.  If the log is of "WINDOW" or "SERVER" type,
			then remove a list of one or more window or server
			refnums to the list.

	Options that modify how the log writes to the logfile
	-----------------------------------------------------
		MANGLE
			Change how stuff written to the log will be "mangled".
			By default, the logfile will be mangled by whatever 
			/SET MANGLE_LOGFILES is set to.
		REWRITE
			Change how stuff written to the log will be "rewritten".
			By default, the logfile is rewritten by whatever 
			/SET LOG_REWRITE is set to.

	Other options
	-------------
		KILL
			Irreversably destroy a logfile.  Once you kill a 
			logfile, you cannot operate on it again.
		DESCRIBE
			Give detailed information about the current state
			of the logfile.
		LIST
			Give brief information about all logfiles.


	Examples:
	---------
	If you wanted to log #epic, you could do something like this:
		/LOG NEW NAME epic-log FILENAME ~/logs/#epic ADD #epic ON
	Then if you wanted to close that log later you could do
		/LOG REFNUM epic-log OFF
	or
		/LOG REFNUM epic-log KILL

	If you wanted to log anything that went to windows 2 or 3:
		/LOG NEW NAME mywinlog FILENAME ~/logs/win23 TYPE windows
		/LOG REFNUM mywinlog ADD 2,3 ON

	If you wanted to log anything that happened on server 2:
		/LOG NEW NAME servlog FILENAME ~/logs/serv2 TYPE servers
		/LOG REFNUM servlog ADD 2 ON

# End of file
