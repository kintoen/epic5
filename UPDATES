EPIC4-1.2.0

*** News 08/12/2002 -- New keybindings system in place (wd)
	The old keybinding system (keys.c) has been completely rewritten to
	add support for various new functionalities.  It is now possible to
	bind arbitrarily long strings of arbitrary values to binding
	functions, as well as to bind substrings of these to other
	functions.  The META system has been removed as a result of this, so
	you can no longer bind to any META*_* functions.  Also, there is
	no longer a META_STATES set.

*** News 08/12/2002 -- New function $bindctl(...) (wd)
	Another side effect of the new keys system, a bindctl function
	has been added which allows for the creation of new binding
	functions, the retrieval of all currently available functions, and
	other low-level interfaces to the binding system.  Detailed
	information can be retrieved in the bindctl(6) help oage.
