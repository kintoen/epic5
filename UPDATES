EPIC4-1.2.0

*** News 11/12/2001 -- New built in functions for file manipulations
	Several new functions have been added to help you manipulate files
	that are opened with $open().

	$fskip(<fd>)
	   This function reads the next line of the file and discards it.
	   It returns the end-of-file condition of the file after the read.
	   If <fd> is not a valid file, -1 is returned.

	$fseek(<fd> <numbytes> <whence>)
	   This function changes the file position indicator.  The file
	   position indicator is moved <numbytes> (a 31 bit signed number)
	   away from <whence>, which is a symbolic anchor with the following
	   possible values:
		SET	Move <numbytes> from the beginning of the file
		CUR	Move <numbytes> forward or backward from the
			current file position indicator
		END	Move <numbytes> forward or backward from the
			end of the file.
	   <numbytes> can't be greater than 2GB, and this is a limitation
	   in the fseek(3) interface, so don't complain to me about it.
	   If a seek error occurs, -1 is returned and $error(<fd>) will
	   return 1.  If <fd> Is not a valid file, -1 is returned.

	$frewind(<fd>)
	   This function sets the file position indicator to the beginning
	   of the file.  It is the same as $seek(<fd> 0 SET).  If <fd> is
	   not a valid file, -1 is returned.

	$ferror(<fd>)
	   This function returns the file error indicator, either 0 or 1.  
	   This is set whenever any error occurs and can be cleared by 
           resetting the file position indicator.  If <fd> is not a valid
	   file, -1 is returned.

	$isfilevalid(<fd>)
	   This function returns 1 if <fd> is a valid value previously 
	   returned by $open() and returns 0 otherwise.
