EPIC4-1.2.0

*** News -- 10/28/2003 -- New /ON, /ON DCC_ACTIVITY
	This hook is activated each time some activity occurs on a 
	/DCC GET or /DCC SEND, particularly whenever the %D status bar
	expando is updated.  The idea is that scripters can stop using %D
	and use the /SET STATUS_USER* expandos to craft their own custom
	%D-like expandos.  The value of $* is the refnum of the dcc that
	had the activity.  You can use this value with $dccctl().  When
	a DCC closes, it throws /on dcc_lost, and then /on dcc_activity
	will be thrown with the -1 refnum.

*** News -- 10/28/2003 -- Everything should support /xdebug extractw now
	If you turn on the experimental feature /xdebug extractw, then
	everything in epic that works on word lists should start supporting
	extended ("double quoted") words.  This includes numeric expandos,
	built in functions, and so on.  Furthermore, anything that outputs
	a word list should surround words with double quotes if they have
	space in them.  Since double quoted words are not honored unless
	you have /xdebug extractw, this is an all-or-nothing thing.  

	This will break some scripts becase of changes like this:
		Old:	$sort(one "two three" four)  -> [four one two three]
		New:	$sort(one "two three" four)  -> [four one "two three"]

	See the doc/word-lists file in the epic source for a very detailed
	list of exactly what does and does not output double-quoted words.

*** News -- 10/28/2003 -- New /SET, /SET WSERV_TYPE [XTERM|SCREEN]
	When you are running EPIC under both screen and X at the same
	time and you do /window create, some people want epic to start
	up a new xterm and some people want epic to start up a new 
	screen window.  The previous default has been a screen window.
	Now you can either /SET WSERV_TYPE XTERM or /SET WSERV_TYPE SCREEN
	to explicitly state your preference, if you have one.  Obviously
	this only matters when you're running epic under BOTH.

*** News -- 10/19/2003 -- $serverctl(SET <refnum> UMODES) now supported
	To work around an unfortunate problem with ratbox, you are now 
	permitted to change the "valid user modes" for a particular server.
	You may want to set this in an /on 005 or some such thing.
