EPIC4-1.2.0

*** News 05/01/2003 -- New command in commandqueues, /timer.ue
	This functions the same as /timer, but won't expand the command
	when it is executed.  It's not quite 100% clean yet.  Don't try
	to execute numbers as commands.

	Also cleaned up /q1cmd to work properly with any input.

*** News 04/10/2003 -- New status expando, %{1}+
	The %+ status expandos returns the empty string (ie, it ignores
	the /set status_mode value) if a channel does not have a mode.
	The %{1}+ status expando will honor /set status_mode, and will
	substitute the empty string for %+.

	Example:  Current channel is #epic, it does not have a mode
		/set status_channel [%C 
		/set status_mode  +%+]
	Then using %C%+ yeilds	[#epic
	And %C%{1}+ yields	[#epic +]

*** News 03/29/2003 -- New /SET, /SET SWITCH_CHANNELS_BETWEEN_WINDOWS
	When this set is ON (default) the SWITCH_CHANNELS key binding
	will have its traditional (legacy) behavior, and will allow you 
	to switch a window's current channel between all of the non-current
	channel windows in all windows connected to the same server.

	When this set is OFF, the SWITCH_CHANNELS key binding will have
	more sensible behavior, allowing you to switch between a window's
	channel list, but without grabbing channels from other windows.
