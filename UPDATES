EPIC4-1.2.0

*** News 07/29/2002 -- New function $killpid(<signal> <pid> [<pid> ...])
	This function sends a signal to another process.  <signal> may either 
	be a signal name (ie, HUP, KILL) or a signal number (ie, 1, 9, 15), 
	and <pid> is a list of one or more pids that you want to kill.  All 
	of the processes are kill(2)ed with the given signal.  The return 
	value is the number of processes that were sucessfully signaled.

*** News 07/29/2002 -- Casualties of IPv6 support
	The following features did not survive the addition of IPv6 to EPIC.
	Please do not ask for these features to be restored.  Such requests
	will not be honored.

	/SET RANDOM_LOCAL_PORTS
		This feature was IPv4 specific.

*** News 07/29/2002 -- (Nearly) Complete IPv6 support
	EPIC now fully supports IPv6 in server descriptions, server 
	connections, $connect(), $listen(), /DCC GET, Virtual Hostnames, 
	$iptoname().  Here are the particulars:

		Server descriptions
			Surround the ipv6 p-addr with square brackets:
			/server [1:2::3]:...

		Server connections
			You can now connect to servers via IPv6!

		$connect(<host> <port> <family>)
			where <family> is "4", "6", "v4" or "v6"
			and <family> is optional.

		$listen(<port> <family>)
			where <family> is "4", "6", "v4" or "v6"
			and <family> is optional.

		/DCC GET
			If you receive a DCC SEND handshake from someone
			else and it uses an IPv6 hostname, you will be able
			to /DCC GET that file.  This is forward compatability.
			Nobody can do /DCC SEND via IPv6 yet.

		Virtual Hostnames
			If the hostname that you choose as your virtual
			hostname has an IPv6 address, then that IPv6 address
			will be used as your virtual host if you connect to
			a server via IPv6.

		$iptoname(<p-addr>)
			Both IPv4 and IPv6 "p-addrs" (ie, A.B.C.D or A::B:C)
			are now supported.

*** News 07/03/2002 -- /STACK now supports keybindings (wd)
	The /STACK command now has added support for keybindings (/BIND).
	The system works in the same manner as the other /STACK types, you
	can push, pop, or list on the bind stack by doing one of
	/STACK (push|pop|list) BIND <keybinding>

*** News 05/26/2002 -- The beginnings of support for IPv6
	On this date I commited the very first set of changes adding 
	infrastructure for IPv6.  If you do not have IPv6 support, EPIC
	may not compile for you until we add compatability shims.  There
	is no timeframe for this -- you may need to stick with EPIC4-1.1.5
	until this conversion is cleared up.

*** News 05/20/2002 -- New functionality to /FE and /FEC
	CrazyEddy needs to document this. =)  Keep a look out in the future
	for updates to this item.

*** News 05/20/2002 -- Clarify distinction between /WINDOW NOSERV and DISCON
	If you do /WINDOW NOSERV, the window is not connected to a server
	and will not be considered connected to a server if you later
	reconnect.  This window should (hopefully) never try to reconnect
	to a server.  If you a /WINDOW DISCON then the window is not connected
	to a server, but it is considered to be disconnected from the server
	so if you later do a reconnect for that server, the window will be
	picked up and re-attached to that server.

*** News 05/20/2002 -- EPIC beginning to move towards protocol independance
	At some point very soon EPIC will start supporting IPv6.  A great
	deal of networking code has been cleaned up in anticipation of this.
