EPIC4-1.2.0

*** News 01/30/2003 -- $serverctl() general cleanup.
	subcommands will be matched against as many characters as are
	supplied.  This means that $serverctl(get 4 007) will not call the
	005 subcommand for eg, but also that in ambiguous cases, the first
	matching subcommand is used where they may not have been before.

*** News 01/30/2003 -- $serverctl(?match *pattern*) does wildcard matching.
	gmatch will return all servers matching group *pattern*.
	imatch will return all servers matching (its) server name *pattern*.
	omatch will return all servers matching (our) server name *pattern*.
	match was never implemented and has been removed.
	pmatch was never implemented and has been removed.

*** News 01/30/2003 -- $serverctl(max)
	$serverctl(max) now returns the number of _slots_ in the server
	list.  Note that this currently equates to the largest number
	of servers in the list at any one time.  It doesn't shrink if
	you delete servers.

*** News 01/30/2003 -- $afterw(), $beforew(), $fromw(), $tow()..
	WARNING:  Incompatible change.  If you experience problems
	because of this change, you should notify #epic on efnet.

	These functions will now do fixed string matching rather than
	pattern matching.  I figure that the old method of implementing
	these functions is fundamentally flawed, and not useful for real
	world applications.  Examination of many publicly available
	scripts seems to indicate that these functions are avoided and
	that where they are used, they constitute latent bugs since text
	matching is desired.

*** News 01/30/2003 -- $writeb() dequotes data.
	This makes it capable of writing binary data.
	$writeb($writefd $read($readfd $numbytes)) will copy $numbytes
	of binary data from one FD to the other faithfully.

*** News 01/30/2003 -- Subsecond /sleep.
	/sleep now accepts floating point arguments.  This makes it much
	the same as /usleep which accepts integer microsecond values,
	but not entirely.

*** News 12/23/2002 -- /exec options tuned.
	-line, -linepart, -error and -errorpart can now be changed for a
	process on the fly, using %process like the other options.

	Using the -window option will now nail the process to the server
	too.

*** News 12/23/2002 -- $xdebug() now accepts masks.

*** News 12/23/2002 -- /redir tuned
	/redir now permits raw dccs to be used.  Also, when used outside
	of the command line script, the $* arguments will now be available.

*** News 12/23/2002 -- New /set, /set FLOATING_POINT_PRECISION
	This sets the number of decimal places of the results of floating
	point math.  Note that this makes FLOATING_POINT_MATH redundant.
