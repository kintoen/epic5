EPIC4-1.2.0

*** News 03/29/2003 -- New /SET, /SET SWITCH_CHANNELS_BETWEEN_WINDOWS
	When this set is ON (default) the SWITCH_CHANNELS key binding
	will have its traditional (legacy) behavior, and will allow you 
	to switch a window's current channel between all of the non-current
	channel windows in all windows connected to the same server.

	When this set is OFF, the SWITCH_CHANNELS key binding will have
	more sensible behavior, allowing you to switch between a window's
	channel list, but without grabbing channels from other windows.
