EPIC4-1.2.0

*** News 06/21/2003 -- New built in script, 'paste', /SET PASTE ON|OFF
	The 'paste' script implements three new sets and one keybinding:

	1) /SET PASTE (ON|OFF)
	2) /SET PASTE_STRIP (ON|OFF)
	3) /SET PASTE_DELAY <number>
	4) Binds key ^P to /SET PASTE TOGGLE

	When you /SET PASTE ON, everything you type at the input prompt is
	taken to be literal text that you're pasting and it is sent to your
	current target without any interpretation by epic.  This means you
	can paste things like C code with comments, or ircII code without
	EPIC interpreting your paste as commands.  When you /SET PASTE OFF,
	everything goes back to normal.  The default is OFF.

	Because it is theoretically possible for you to get stuck into
	paste mode, where you would be unable to /SET PASTE OFF, there are
	two ways out of "paste mode".  The ^P (control-P) key binding will
	toggle the paste mode, turning it off if it is on (and turning it 
	on if it is off...).  The "paste mode" feature also turns itself
	off after a short delay, which you can control with /SET PASTE_DELAY.
	The default paste delay is 30 seconds.

	Anguzhawk, who asked me for this script originally, also wanted to
	able to strip off leading whitespace on pre-formatted text that
	he was pasting.  If you /SET PASTE_STRIP ON, then epic will remove
	all leading whitespace from any text you paste.  If you 
	/SET PASTE_STRIP OFF, everything goes back to normal.  The default
	is OFF.
