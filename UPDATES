EPIC4-1.2.0

*** News -- 11/21/2003 -- /SERVER <host> now honors server groups
	Whenever EPIC tries to connect to a new server, particularly
	when you do /SERVER <host> it will honor the server group of
	the new server; if you cannot connect to <host> it will only
	try to connect to other servers in the same group as <host>.

*** News -- 11/21/2003 -- New math parser can now use 64 bit integers
	The new experimental math parser (which you can turn on via 
	/xdebug new_math) can now support 64 bit integers.  This is 
	auto-detected when you run 'configure' and $info(o) will include
	the letter 'l' for you scripters who want to be able to tell when
	the host client can do big math and when it can't.
