EPIC4-1.2.0

*** News -- 12/16/2003 -- New levels, KICK, QUIT, and MODE
	So just for a canonical list, here are all of the levels supported
	by flood, ignore, lastlog, and windows:
		CRAP	PUBLIC	MSG	NOTICE	WALL	WALLOP
		NOTE	OPNOTE	SNOTE	ACTION	DCC	CTCP
		INVITE	JOIN	NICK	TOPIC	PART	QUIT
		KICK	MODE	USER1	USER2	USER3	USER4
		ALL (special)	NONE (special)	HELP (special)

*** News -- 12/16/2003 -- Unification of ignore, flood, and lastlog levels
	Previously, the ignore, flood, and lastlog levels used the same
	names, but they had different meanings in each subsystem (ie, CRAP 
	in flood was different from CRAP in ignore, and CRAP in lastlog).
	Now all three subsystems use the same levels, all named the same,
	and (more or less) all defined the same.  There are some holes in
	this conversion cause I didn't check every possible combination.
	Report any odd behavior to me so I can fix it.

*** News -- 12/16/2003 -- New noise type for /ON, /ON %TYPE
	The /ON %TYPE modifier acts just like /ON ^TYPE, because it
	suppresses the default action, but it is unlike /ON ^TYPE
	because it does not turn off the display (what /ON ^TYPE
	does is it prefixes all the commands in the ON body with 
	the ^ modifier, which turns off output for that command.)
	This new modifer does not prefix each command with ^, so any
	commands not so prefixed will generate their normal output.	
	The idea is you can use this for /on set's
		/ON %SET "HOLD_MODE *" {WINDOW HOLD_MODE $*}

*** News -- 12/16/2003 -- Removed /SET BEEP_WHEN_AWAY
	This feature can be re-implemented in one line of script:
		/ON #MSG 617 * {IF (A) {BEEP}}

*** News -- 12/16/2003 -- Removed /SET BEEP_ON_MSG
	The /SET BEEP_ON_MSG feature has been removed because it was only
	half-implemented, and even that half didn't work right.  Keep an
	eye out for a scripted re-implementation of this in the future.

*** News -- 12/16/2003 -- Runtime auto-append-of-$* removed
	Historically, the ircII language has allowed you to auto-append
	$* onto the end of an alias at runtime by creating an alias that
	does not refer to any of the command line arguments.  For example,
		/alias m msg
	behaves at runtime as
		/alias m msg $*
	but with a performance penalty.  This behavior has now been removed
	and if you wish to have $* appended to your aliases, you need to 
	change them.  This change would be backwards compatable with epic4.
